            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Honourable Founder of these Lectures having appointed them for proving the Christian Religion against notorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, <hi>viz.</hi> Atheists, Deists, Pagans, Jews, and Mahometans, my design is, by God's Assistance, to direct my following Discourses prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally against the second sort of these Adversaries to our Profession, the <hi>Deists</hi> I mean, properly so call'd, those who are not sunk so much below humane Nature, as to call into question the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their Beings, or to deny that Providence by which the World is govern'd, and themselves and all things in it preserv'd and taken care of: but yet pretend to disbelieve, or at least doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Christian Revelation.</p>
                  <p>It must needs seem strange to those who are throughly convinc'd of the Trutho of Christianity, and discern very plain and strong Evidence for the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52618:4"/>confirmation of their Faith in all the parts of it, that there should be any, who being educated where this Religion is profess'd, should either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main or become Infidels; especially if at the same time they seriously own the Principles of <hi>natural</hi> Religion, to which those of <hi>reveal'd</hi> are so very agreeable.</p>
                  <p>How far such men are in good earnest, is best known to God, and to their own Consciences: but if there be any such, 'tis certainly worth the while to convince them; and I should hope it would be no great difficulty to do it, provided they may be prevail'd upon to do what is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary, and highly reasonable on their part, in order to their receiving and owning such conviction.</p>
                  <p>For which reason I have chosen to begin with these Words, wherein we are inform'd by our Lord himself, what sort of Persons those are, who are qualified for receiving him and his Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> such as <hi>are taught of God,</hi> such as <hi>have heard and learn'd of the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The occasion of the Words was this. Our blessed Saviour had been saying,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er. 38,</note> that <hi>He came down from Heaven;</hi> at this some of the <hi>Jews murmur'd,</hi> saying,
<note place="margin">41,</note>
                     <hi>Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose Father and Mother we know?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">42,</note>
                     <hi>How is it then that he saith, I came down from Heaven?</hi> To which our Lord reply'd, not by proposing at that time any Arguments to convince them, that he really did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52618:4"/>come down from Heaven; but by hinting to them the true cause of their unbelief, and letting them understand, that considering their temper, which he very well knew,
<note place="margin">Ver. 43, 44.</note> he was not at all surpris'd at their rejecting him. <hi>Murmur not,</hi> saith he, <hi>among your selves. No man can come to me, except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which hath sent me, draw him.</hi> But may not <hi>the Father draw</hi> men, and they not follow him? Yes certainly,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 24.13.</note> as well as he might be said to <hi>have purged Israel,</hi> and yet that <hi>Israel was not purged;</hi> and therefore it follows in the next Words, <hi>It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is written in the Prophets,</hi> that is, this is a Prediction you may find in divers places in the Books of the Prophets, in the Old Testament; <hi>They shall be all taught of God,</hi> that is, in the days of the Messiah, the World shall be blest with more plentiful Instruction from Heaven, there shall be a greater measure of Divine Knowledge imparted by God to Mankind, together with a larger Effusion of the Divine Spirit upon the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of God's Church, whereby they shall be taught the Will of God more plainly and fully, than in times past. Particularly the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling the state of the Church in the days of the Messiah, hath these very words which our Lord citeth, <hi>All thy children shall be taught of the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 54.13.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learn'd of the Father, cometh unto me;</hi> as if he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52618:5"/>had said, Whosoever therefore will come unto me, that is, receive me for the Messiah, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my Doctrine to be of God, must be <hi>taught of God,</hi> according to the prediction of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and on his part he must both <hi>hear and learn of the Father,</hi> he must attend, that is, to his Instructions, and comply with them. For if he shall refuse to <hi>hear the Father,</hi> he can never acknowledge me, who came from him: but if he will <hi>hear and learn</hi> of him, and consequently be <hi>taught</hi> by him, he will readily <hi>come to me</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>So that the Words contain, as I have already observ'd, the Character of those Persons, who are qualified and dispos'd to receive the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when it is publish'd to them.</p>
                  <p>And this I judge a proper Argument to begin with. For should I be able to produce never so convincing proofs of the Truth of Christianity; yet if those who hear me should be utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispos'd to consider and receive them, all my discourse must be necessarily lost upon such men. And therefore 'tis remarkable, that our Saviour, in divers other places as well as this, doth ascribe the Infidelity of his Hearers to the Indisposition of their Minds, as the true cause of it; and that too an Indisposition proceeding from some fault either in their Tempers or Practices: as on the contrary he declareth who were in a fair way to become his Disciples, namely, such as were of a Temper capable of considering and receiving Truth, when it should be propos'd to them. Thus,
<note place="margin">Joh. 8.47.</note>
                     <hi>He that is of God, heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52618:5"/>And again, <hi>To this end was I born,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 18.37.</note>
                     <hi>and for this cause came I into world, that I might bear witness to the Truth. Every one that is of the Truth heareth my Voice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is this asserted by our Lord, without evident Reason, as will appear to any one, who considers this matter fairly.</p>
                  <p>Christianity lays it's claim to a Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Both our Lord himself, and all who call themselves his Disciples, affirm that it is a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God. The Adversaries of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion say on the contrary, that it is the Product of Superstition or Design, and consequently that both its Original and Progress are wholy owing to humane Weakness, or Policy, that is, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness; (for such would a Policy to invent and propagate a false Religion, and thereby to impose upon the Understandings and Consciences of men, be justly reputed.) How then must this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie be decided? Why by such Evidence as a matter of this nature is capable of; by such Proofs as are fit to be alleged for the truth of a Divine Revelation, and proper to convince the judgment of a reasonable Creature. But who shall Judge of this Evidence? Why every man must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to judge for himself, and every man to whom such Evidence is propos'd, is without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion oblig'd, at his utmost peril, to judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. But the Man that is ignorant of Almighty God, or estranged from him, especially whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is an Enemy to God, as being of a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temper opposite to that of the Divine Nature, must necessarily be unfit to judge of this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52618:6"/>kind of Evidence. If this Religion should prove to be divinely reveal'd, as it pretends, such a man would probably think it his Interest, to be sure it would be his Inclination, to make all the Objections, and to raise all the Cavils, that he could possibly invent, to invalidate the Proofs of it. At least he would not easily, nor clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discern the force of the Arguments alleged for it.</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the other hand, Whosoever hath been <hi>taught of God,</hi> whosoever hath <hi>heard, and learn'd of the Father,</hi> whosoever hath attain'd to right conceptions of him, and is reconcil'd in his Mind to him, such a Man is well prepar'd to attend to whatsoever it shall please God far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make known to him, he will easily and clearly discern the force of any good Evidence which shall be produc'd for a Revelation which is truly Divine, and will be naturally ready and forward to embrace it.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the Words themselves, in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, it will be proper to consider these <hi>three</hi> particulars.</p>

                  <p>Let us consider in what way and manner <hi>God</hi> may be said <hi>to teach</hi> Men,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in order to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any new Revelation from him. <hi>It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Prophets, They shall be all taught of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>teaching of God</hi> which the Prophets, and particularly <hi>Isaiah,</hi> in the place before-cited, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to, seems, as I have already hinted, to be that more plain and plentiful Instruction, which was to be communicated to Men, in the days of the Messiah. But our Saviour, in applying this Prophecy, seems also to take in all that previous <hi>Teaching of God,</hi> whereby he had prepar'd Men for the receiving him, when he should come. For the same God, who by his Providence had reserv'd so large a communication of Divine Knowledge, for the times of the Messiah, had from one Generation to another, been disposing the World for such farther communications as he should think proper for it; not having in any age or place, <hi>left men without witness of himself.</hi> It may be reasonable therefore upon this occasion, to consider the several ways, in which men might be said to be <hi>taught of God,</hi> in order to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any farther Revelation from him. And I shall name these <hi>four.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men were <hi>taught of God,</hi> in order to this end,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by the Works of Creation and Providence.</p>
                  <p>By the Suggestions and Dictates of their own Consciences.

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52618:7"/>
                  <p>By the secret Motions and Influences of the Divine Spirit upon the Minds of Men.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall only take a short view of each of these.</p>
                  <p>Men may be said to have been <hi>taught of God,</hi> by the Works of Creation and Providence.</p>
                  <p>From that vast number of Beings, which have been form'd by God, their Variety, Excellency, Beauty, and Order, together with the constant care he taketh of all that he hath form'd, and the abundant Provision he hath made for every Being, suitable to it's Nature there are plain Intimations and Instructions given by the Deity, to those Creatures whom he hath made capable of observing and contemplating his Works. And this I may take for granted, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof, will be allow'd by those, for whose use I principally design my following Discourses, such I mean as seriously own the Being and the Providence of the Almighty. And I need not labor to express my self farther upon this head, than in the Words of the Psalmist, which a Deist will subscribe to as true, though not as spoken by an inspired Author.
<note place="margin">Psal. 10.1,</note>
                     <hi>The Heavens declare the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God: and the Firmament sheweth his handy work.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Day unto day uttereth speech; and night un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to night sheweth knowledge.</hi> And this is a way in which God hath <hi>taught</hi> all Mankind at once; for as it there follows,

                     <hi>There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.</hi>

                     <hi>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse;</hi> those namely who do not by this instruction from the <hi>visible</hi> World, discern <hi>the invisible things of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath taught men also by the Suggestions and Dictates of their own Minds.

                  </p>
                  <p>Nor will this be denied by any, who seriously own a God and a Providence; <hi>viz.</hi> that there is in man a power of Understanding and Reasoning, which he hath receiv'd from God in the very frame of his Nature, whereby he is inabled to discern the Being, and in some measure to know the Will of his Maker; as also a Conscience, whereby he reflects upon his own behaviour, and is either pleas'd or displeas'd with himself, and fill'd with Hopes or Fears, according as he acts agreeably or disagreeably to the judgment of his own Mind.</p>
                  <p>Whether there are innate Ideas in the Souls of Men; or whether only we are capacitated in the use of our Faculties to form such conceptions as these, and so framed that we naturally do it, is not material, as to the subject I am now upon. It is enough, if this be any way the result of our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52618:8"/>Frame and Constitution; for then it must be one of the ways in which God, who is the Author of our Beings, hath given us Instruction. And this again cannot be exprest better, than in the words of St.

                  </p>
                  <p>God may be said farther to have <hi>taught</hi> men,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by some extraordinary Persons rais'd up by Providence, and qualified to instruct others.</p>
                  <p>Such we Christians believe the Patriarchs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets to have been, namely Persons raised up on purpose, and some of them sent with a special Commission from God, to teach men. But because in these Discourses we are to take no more for granted, than those we have to do with will allow, I shall assert no more under this head, than what will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by every serious Deist, <hi>viz.</hi> that there have been in all ages Persons of more enlarg'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd Understandings, and more refin'd Morals than the Vulgar, who have both by their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and writings, and practices instructed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men with respect to Divine and Spiritual Matters. Such particularly we know there were, not inconsiderable for their Number, and of very great Reputation, both among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52618:8"/>
                     <hi>Romans,</hi> some of which have by their Writings transmitted to us their conceptions concerning God and Providence, and the difference between Moral Good and Evil, as also the spirituality and immortality of the humane Soul, and at least the high probability of a future state of retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of all which they have discourst admirably well.</p>
                  <p>And of this rank we may at least reckon the Patriarchs mention'd in the Old Testament, who practis'd, and taught the Worship of the One true God, the Maker of Heaven and Earth, and gave an Example of Virtuous Lives and Conversations; as also <hi>Moses,</hi> the great Law giver among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who particularly inculcated this prime Doctrine of Religion, that there is but one God, the Creator and Governor of all, and gave abundance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Moral Precepts, besides the Ceremonial, to that People; as likewise the Prophets which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in that Nation, and made it their business to preach up the Doctrines of Piety, and Virtue. Whoever owns a Providence, and allows the difference between Moral Good and Evil, must and will grant that such men as these, wherever they were to be found, were the Instruments of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for instructing and improving their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures, and consequently that this was another way of <hi>God's teaching</hi> men.</p>
                  <p>God may also be said to have <hi>taught</hi> men, by the secret Motions and Influences of his Holy Spirit upon their Minds.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52618:9"/>
                  <p>This I am well satisfied the Holy Scriptures do assert throughout, and 'tis, in part at least, this kind of <hi>teaching,</hi> which those passages in the Books of the Prophets, referr'd to by our Saviour in the Text, seem to mean; neither is it any more than what I think those whom we have to do with in this Controversie will allow.</p>
                  <p>There is indeed nothing more reasonable to be believ'd of God, even without a Revelation, than that he who form'd our Spirits, which are finite, and intirely dependent upon their Maker, should be at all times ready to influence them in a way proper to their make, conversing himself intimately with them, enlightning those understandings which he hath given us, by rays darted from himself, the Fountain of Light, secretly admonishing and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Souls, according as they apply themselves to him, and become capable of receiving Influences from him.</p>
                  <p>This is well exprest by <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> who being suppos'd not to have been of the race of <hi>Israel,</hi> may be reckon'd to have spoken in the person of a Deist;
<note place="margin">Job 32.8.</note>
                     <hi>There is,</hi> says he, <hi>a spirit in man, and the Inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> But we need not search nicely for a Proof, that this has been the sense of those, who have been only under the dispensation of meer Nature, and nor enlighten'd by Revelation. 'Tis well known to all that are acquainted with the Writings of the Philosophers, that this is frequently acknowledg'd by them.
<note place="margin">Cic. <hi>de nat. Deor.</hi> l. 2.</note>
                     <hi>Nemo vir magnus sine aliquo afflatû di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino unquam fuit,</hi> is a famous saying of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s, <hi>There was never yet any great Man, but who had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52618:9"/>something of divine Inspiration,</hi> in which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd not his own sense only, but that of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. <hi>Socrates</hi>

                     </gap> likewise famous for his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a constant, at least very frequent direction and influence from the Deity, who I think, if any other among the Pagan Philosophers, may be fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow'd such a pretence.</p>
                  <p>And it is no Objection against this way of <hi>God's teaching,</hi> that we cannot tell in what manner he influenceth our Spirits, any more than it is against his having made us, that we are wholly ignorant how we were formed by him.</p>
                  <p>This may suffice to be spoken to the <hi>first</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I propos'd, I proceed to the next, <hi>viz.</hi> to consider,</p>
                  <p>Who they are,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> that may be said to have <hi>heard and learn'd of the Father,</hi> in order to their receiving any new Revelation from him. <hi>Every man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath heard and learn'd,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer in the General, Those men have <hi>heard and learn'd of the Eather,</hi> in order to this end, who have attended to the Instructions given them by God, in any of the <hi>four</hi> ways a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned, and have improv'd them to the benefit of their Spirits. But more particularly they may be reduced to these <hi>two</hi> following sorts.</p>
                  <p>Those who have attain'd to worthy apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning God and natural Religion.

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52618:10"/>fixt in their Minds an honest purpose and resolution to act agreeably to them.</p>
                  <p>By taking a short view of these <hi>two</hi> particulars, we shall easily perceive, both that these are the results of <hi>God's teaching</hi> men, and that they are each of them preparatory to the receiving farther communications from him.</p>
                  <p>Such men have <hi>heard and learn'd of the Father,</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52618:10"/>all compassionable cases, and to make all such allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances as are proper to be made by a Creator to his Creatures.</p>
                  <p>By worthy apprehensions of natural Religion, I mean, that they should see and acknowledge the eternal and immutable difference between moral good and evil, together with the necessary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Obligation a reasonable creature is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to chuse the one, and refuse the other; that they should discern the fitness of yielding Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and Love, Worship, and Obedience to our Maker; of exercising Justice and Charity one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another; of subjecting our Flesh to our Spirits; and reducing our Appetites and Passions under the direction and government of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reason; of improving our Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

These I take to be worthy apprehensions of God and natural Religion, and such as will be entertain'd by all those, who are <hi>taught of God,</hi> and have not only <hi>heard,</hi> but <hi>learn'd of the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whosoever hath these Apprehensions well settled in his Mind, will be always ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a Doctrine which comes from God, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it self to be worthy of him; he will be apt to entertain a Revelation as Divine, which renders all the Attributes of God conspicuous and illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; he will diligently listen to, and easily believe a fair account of the Goodness of God to the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state children of men, reconcil'd with his Wisdom and Justice in governing the World; and he will heartily approve an Institution, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Upon this ground it was, that our Lord gave his approbation to the Judgment of the Scribe, upon his saying there was <hi>one God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 12.32, 33, 34.</note> and that for a Man <hi>to love this God with all his heart, and to love his Neighbour as himself,</hi> was <hi>more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</hi> The Text says, that <hi>when Jesus saw that he answer'd discreetly, i. e.</hi> when he discover'd so just apprehensions of God, and the nature of Religion in general, <hi>he said unto him, Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God;</hi> as far as his Judgment went at least, he was almost a Disciple of Christ, being well dispos'd to entertain the Doctrine which he taught. But then,</p>
                  <p>There must be added to this,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that those who have <hi>heard and learn'd of the Father,</hi> have together with these Apprehensions fixt in their Minds an honest purpose and resolution to act agreeably to them.</p>
                  <p>The perfection of a reasonable creature consists in the regularity of his Will and Affections, as much at least, if not more than in the improvement of his Understanding. Nay the very use of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation given to the Understanding is, that it may direct and influence the Will and Affections of the Man; and consequently the great design of all <hi>God's teaching,</hi> which is without question in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to perfect our Natures, is to improve the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52618:11"/>temper and disposition of our Souls; so that no man can be said to have <hi>heard and learn'd of the Father,</hi> till he have form'd his temper by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is imparted to him from God, and reduc'd his Notions to practice. All the Truths of God are to be <hi>receiv'd in the love of them,</hi> and the end of their communication is, that we may yield our selves to be directed by them; and he that is arriv'd thus far, has <hi>heard and learn'd of the Father,</hi> in the full sense of that Expression; and after this, can want nothing more towards the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any new Revelation from God, than a fair proposal of it to him.</p>
                  <p>This is agreeable to what our Saviour hath told us, and what is evident from the nature of the thing, that <hi>If any man will do the will of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 7.17.</note>
                     <hi>he shall know of his Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether he spake of himself.</hi> And this 'tis likely was wanting in the Scribe before-mention'd, whom our Saviour declar'd <hi>not to be far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> Had he added to his just apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Divine truths, a full purpose of mind to yield to their influence, he would not only have <hi>approach'd,</hi> but <hi>enter'd</hi> into the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And here in truth lies the main difficulty with most men. Their Apprehensions would be more easily set right, if their Wills and Affections were but subdued: but this latter requiring some pains, they too often make their Judgments comply with their Inclinations, and suffer their Wills and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to conduct their Understandings.</p>

                  <p>A serious and compos'd temper of Spirit.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a Qualification necessary in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in any other sort of learning, that is of considerable use; and much more is it so, where God is the Teacher, and Religion the Subject of the Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>God is a great Being, infinitely above us; the thoughts of his Majesty are sufficient to strike an awe into our Minds. He is perfectly pure and holy, he hath full Authority to command us, and an irresistible Power, as well as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to govern and controll us; and our Happiness depends intirely upon his favour.</p>
                  <p>Religion is the solemn Obligation we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our selves to be under to this excellent Being, whereby we are instructed in his Will, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to comply with it; and the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in particular pretends to be an improvement of that which is natural.</p>
                  <p>Now these are matters of the greatest Weight, and highest Concernment to us, and consequently such as require the most sedate temper of Mind in those who are conversant about them.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52618:12"/>
                  <p>Besides that the ways in which <hi>God teacheth</hi> men are such as make a very serious attention necessary. 'Tis remarkable, that when our blessed Saviour had in the Text mention'd <hi>hearing and learning of the Father,</hi> he adds in the very next words, <hi>Not that any man hath seen the Father,</hi> intimating thereby that we do not learn of God, as one man learns of another. No, 'tis by serious contemplation of his Works; by frequent retiring into our own Souls, exercising and consulting the best of our Faculties, those I mean of Understanding, and Reason, and Conscience; 'tis by looking out for those who are wiser and better than our selves, and attending to what they shall impart to us of their knowledge in Divine matters; and finally 'tis by cherishing and improving the secret Motions and Influences of the good Spirit of God, and in a due exercise of our Faculties, together with a serious applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, preparing our selves for the reception of his communications.</p>
                  <p>How then is it likely, that a man of a fantastical, airy and unthinking temper, should <hi>hear and learn of the Father,</hi> or <hi>come to the Son!</hi> 'Tis not in the least probable, that such an one should apply himself to the consideration of these serious Subjects, or give that attention of Mind which is proper; nor can it be thought, that the Holy Spirit of God should attend such light and unsettled minds.</p>
                  <p>Another Qualification for <hi>hearing and learning of the Father</hi> is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a good degree of Humility.</p>
                  <p>It becomes a Learner in general to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>efe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52618:13"/>to the judgment and authority of those who instruct him; much more is it fit that those who would <hi>learn of God,</hi> should attend to his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with the greatest Humility that is possible. They should have those mean thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves which become Creatures, when they are learning of their Maker. They should remember that their Minds are finite and narrow, that their apprehensions of things are very imperfect at the best, that they are fallible, nay exceeding liable to be mistaken of themselves, and consequently do stand in need of the constant direction and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the first and great Mind. They should consider farther, that they are altogether unworthy of such a favor, as to be <hi>taught of God,</hi> forasmuch as they cannot but be conscious of very great disorder in their Natures, too much indisposition to do, and consequently to know the Will of God. All these considerations will be apt to make them humble, and thereby dispose them <hi>to hear and learn of the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For by this means they will be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the reasonableness of those great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which natural Religion enjoyns, <hi>viz.</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and resigning their Wills intirely to the Will of their Sovereign Lord; being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his disposal, and fully satisfied with that share of the good things of life, which he is pleas'd to allow them; depending upon him, and acknowledging him in all their ways; as also demeaning themselves towards other men with a regard due to those of the same nature with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, however they may differ from them in some accident respects.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52618:13"/>
                  <p>And by the same means they will be dispos'd also <hi>to come to the Son of God,</hi> whose Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lays before us abundance of humbling consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, drawn from the weakness and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humane Nature, as well as from the guilt we have contracted; and gives us in charge such Precepts as cannot possibly consist with pride or haughtiness of spirit, such as condescending to those of the lowest rank for their good, bearing affronts, forgiving injuries, returning good for evil, and the like; upon which account our Lord saw it fit to forewarn those that pretended to be his Disciples, that one necessary condition of being so, was <hi>to humble themselves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 18.3, 4.</note> and <hi>become as little children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay farther, this Humility will dispose those who are endued with it, to allow, that God may possibly reveal to us some Truths of concernment and use, which we could not have found out our selves, and which when discover'd in part, we may not be able fully to grasp and comprehend; as well as he may oblige us to some Duties, which may lie cross to certain inclinations and propensions that we may have contracted, which duties may notwithstanding be very reasonable in themselves and good for us. A competent degree of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will dispose us to think on this manner; and consequently will render us capable of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                  <p>Which it will yet farther do, by qualifying us to partake of the Illumination and Assistance of the Spirit of that God, who, as we are assured both by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52618:14"/>Scripture and Reason,
<note place="margin">Pet. 5.5.</note>
                     <hi>resisteth the proud; but giveth Grace to the humble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last Qualification I mention'd was Purity of Heart;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by which I mean, not only a freedom from guile and hypocrisie, but also, in a good degree from all those other vitious habits, that defile the Soul, and particularly a being so far dis-entangled from sensual and worldly inclinations, that the mind may be tolerably at liberty in it's searches after truth, having no strong byas upon it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it the wrong way, nothing whereby the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding must be unavoidably blinded, or the judgment distorted.</p>
                  <p>'Tis acknowledg'd by every serious Deist, that as God is a pure and holy Being, so the design of true Religion is to render us like to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to refine and purifie our Spirits, by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us above the things of sense and this present life. And this we Christians affirm to be the great design of that Religion which we profess. Now nothing can make us more indisposed to <hi>hear and learn</hi> either of <hi>the Father</hi> or <hi>the Son,</hi> than strong habits of Vice indulg'd by us, or, which comes to the same issue, being deeply immerst in the sensual and animal life. This was the reason why <hi>Aristotle</hi> pronounc'd young men unfit to hear Lectures in moral Philosophy, namely because of the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of their sensual inclinations and passions. Christianity, in confidence of its reasonableness, together with the assistance and strength it offers, proposes it self to every age, as well as each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men: but still this must be own'd, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52618:14"/>by how much the more sensual or worldly-minded any man is, by so much the more he is in danger of having his Understanding byas'd in his enquiries after the truths of Religion. 'Tis an uneasie thing to own a truth, which directly opposes it self to the bent of our inclinations; and therefore a man that is resolvedly vitious, will rather chuse to have his understanding mifled, and his judgment brib'd, than yield his assent to such truths, as he very well knows would prove a constant vexation to his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Besides, that as in the former instances, so here also, it cannot be expected that the Holy Spirit of God, by whom the minds of all good men are il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated and assisted in their searches after divine knowledge, should co-habit or co-operate with a soul grosly impure and vitious.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have dispatch'd the <hi>three</hi> particulars I at first propos'd, and the sum of what I have been saying is in short this; That whosoever will take upon him to judge of the truth of reveal'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or <hi>that</hi> which pretends to be so, ought to be a man, who has first well consider'd, and yielded to the convictions of <hi>that</hi> which is natural; and that there are certain Qualifications necessary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the considering and entertaining either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, or reveal'd.</p>
                  <p>The application I would make of the whole shall be only in <hi>two</hi> words.</p>
                  <p>I infer that if any person,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> who is not furnish'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52618:15"/>with the Qualifications above-mention'd in a good degree, and for want of them hath not been <hi>taught of God,</hi> shall yet take upon him to deny the truth of the Christian Religion, he is to be neglected as one that is no competent Judge in this dispute. Jesus Christ may be the Son of God, and the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Mankind, and his Religion may have had its original from Heaven, as we Christians profess heartily to believe, for any thing such a man knows, or can know to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore remarkable what I hinted in the beginning of this discourse, that our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth upon all occasions ascribe the unbelief of his Hearers to the indisposition of their tempers, to their pride and vain-glory, their sensuality and love of the present World, their ignorance of God and of the nature of Religion in general, to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected blindness, and the wilful hardness of their hearts; and the Apostles likewise do the same.</p>
                  <p>And in like manner, if Infidelity has prevail'd in a high degree in the Age and Nation in which we live, we may by a very little observation find out the true grounds and reasons of it.</p>
                  <p>A considerable number of those who reject Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, do at the same time openly express their contempt of all Religion in general; and not only so, but even of every thing that is serious and of weight in humane life. They are men of light and inconsiderate tempers, who very hardly admit of any serious thoughts even about the common affairs of the World; Such whose time is wasted in sport and luxury, who have never improv'd or exercised their higher Faculties, according to the design of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52618:15"/>their Natures, nor furnish'd their Heads with any solid materials to think upon.</p>
                  <p>There are others who are not it may be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so airy and unthinking; but yet being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vitious, violently addicted to the gratifying their sensual Inclinations, or deeply engag'd in the love and pursuit of this vain World, however serious and compos'd they may sometimes be, when they concern themselves about secular affairs, they put the thoughts of God and Religion far from them; as creating uneasiness to their Minds, disturbing and interrupting them in their Enjoyments, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing continual scruples and doubts and fears within them.</p>
                  <p>There are some few besides, not to be reduc'd to either of the former ranks, who yet by their supercilious, and scornful way of treating reveal'd Religion, discover such a degree of haughtiness and self-conceit, such a vain opinion of their own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings and ways of thinking, and such a scorn and difdain with respect to all that shall presume to differ from them, as plainly shews them not at all to be under the government of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is natural.</p>
                  <p>Now whenever the Question is concerning the truth of Christianity, it cannot with any shew of reason be referr'd to these mens Judgments. They are either wholly unconcern'd in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or too evidently prejudic'd to judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; so that there lies an Appeal from them to the more serious, modest, humble and honest part of Mankind.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THESE Words are the more remarkable to our present purpose, because they were written by one, who, as himself tells us, had been <hi>before a Blasphemer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note>
                     <hi>and a Persecutor, and injurious;</hi> that is, he had bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inveighed against the Christian Profession, and 'tis very probable had spoken ill of its divine Author; 'tis certain he had vex'd and persecuted the Disciples of Jesus in a most grievous manner: and yet after all this was thorowly convinc'd of the Truth and Excellency of the Christian Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and was not only so honest as to own this his Conviction upon all occasions, but endeavour'd also to make what reparation he could to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Lord, and his injur'd Disciples, by a zealous preaching and promoting this Religion in the World.</p>
                  <p>Where by the way it may not be unseasonable to remark, that whatsoever injuries he had done to our Lord, his Doctrine, or his Followers, had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52618:19"/>been the Effect of <hi>Ignorance and Ʋnbelief;</hi> nay, he <hi>verily thought with himself that he ought to do</hi> what he did,

He was not a man that acted against the present Judgment and Conviction of his own Mind: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as he elsewhere tells the great Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi>

                     </gap>tter of Christianity, and in that respect not <hi>good;</hi> but what he means is, that he acted according to his then present Perswasion; and therefore he says, he obtained Mercy; <hi>because he did it ignorantly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note>
                     <hi>in unbelief;</hi> which I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of partly as an Admonition to all of us, to beware how we indulge any kind of Prejudices, whereby our Judgments may be byassed in our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after Truth; seeing this otherwise well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispos'd Man was, meerly from the force of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices unwarily receiv'd, kept off from embracing Christianity, nay put upon doing very unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and evil things: but especially I mention this as a serious Warning to such, as shall in any degree act against their Consciences, those who knowingly and wilfully allow themselves in any Vice, presuming to contradict the plain Rules of Natural Religion, even such as they cannot but allow to be so. Had St. <hi>Paul</hi> done thus in his state of <hi>Judaism,</hi> we have reason to conclude, from what he says of himself, that in all likelyhood he had not <hi>obtain'd</hi> that <hi>Mercy,</hi> whereby he became a Christian. But to proceed.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52618:19"/>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> being a Person, on whom God thought it fit to bestow a Miracle, to conquer the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices he lay under, and being by that means tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly convinc'd of his former Error, and of the Truth of Christianity, he had from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a very warm sense of the Goodness and Mercy of God, both to himself in particular, and to Sinners in general, in appointing this admirable Method for our Salvation, which he expresseth very emphatically in the words of my Text, <hi>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners; of whom,</hi> says he, <hi>I am chief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And were we all but as deeply sensible of the evil and danger of Sin, and of the wretchedness of our state consider'd as Sinners, as our Apostle was, we should have the very same apprehensions concerning the Salvation offer'd to us by Jesus Christ, which he had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is a faithful saying,</hi>

                     </gap>, that is, 'tis not only evidently true; but 'tis moreover what we ought to receive with all readiness and thankfulness, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring and adoring the divine Goodness therein exprest towards the Children of Men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating one with another upon account of the Benefits we receive thereby, entertaining what God hath thus reveal'd to us with most grateful and joyful hearts. <hi>That Christ Jesus came into the world, to save Sinners;</hi> This is the <hi>saying</hi> which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52618:20"/>the Apostle so highly magnifies, and recommends to our acceptance, and which is the summe of the Christian Revelation, that the only-begotten Son of God appear'd in Humane Nature, in order to the saving the apostate Children of Men; that is, to the delivering them from the guilt and the power of their Sins, and the confering upon them all that Happiness which their Nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
                  <p>My business in treating on this Argument will be, by God's assistance, to make good this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by such Evidence as is fit to be offer'd to one who antecedently believes the Being of God, and his Providence, and hath his internal <hi>sense exercised to discern</hi> Moral <hi>good and evil.</hi>

                  <p>Now the Truth of this <hi>saying,</hi> and its Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be receiv'd by us must appear, either by the intrinsick Evidence which it carries along with it, I mean the Credibility of the thing it self: or the external Attestation which hath been given to it, both which are included in this Expression, <hi>Faithful, and worthy of all acceptation.</hi> 'Tis highly worthy of God, and exceedingly Beneficial to us his Creatures, and upon both accounts credible: 'tis also sufficiently attested from without, which still increases its Credibility.</p>
                  <p>The Attestation it hath receiv'd from without, <hi>viz.</hi> from Prophecies compar'd with Events; from Miracles wrought in confirmation of it; from the surprizing success of its being publish'd to the World, is of great use, both for the exciting Men seriously to consider it, and the perswading them to believe it; and that the rather, because it must
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52618:20"/>be own'd, that there are some particulars within the compass of the Christian Revelation, and some circumstances attending it, which we could not have thought of our selves, and which we are not able fully to comprehend or to account for, even after they are in part discover'd; but must submit our Faith to the Declaration of Almighty God, as it is very fit that a Creature should submit it self in all things to its Maker. Besides that there may be some Doctrines which may thwart the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly receiv'd Prejudices of Mankind, and may therefore require something more than their meer internal Evidence, at least at first, to awaken Men to a thorow and impartial Consideration of them.</p>
                  <p>But yet forasmuch as I am verily perswaded, that God never did, and that he is so Good, that he never will or can give any external Attestation to what directly contradicts the Faculties he hath given us by Nature, nay not to any thing, but what if thorowly and impartially consider'd will in the main appear in its own nature reasonable and credible, I shall therefore begin with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick Evidence of the Assertion in our Text, shewing from the Nature and Reason of what is here affirm'd, that it is a <hi>credible Saying,</hi> every way worthy of God, and very fit to be most readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by us, <hi>that Christ Jesus came into the World to save Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In doing this, the Text will lead me into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Method, by offering to our Consideration these <hi>three</hi> general heads, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>last</hi> of these will take up a considerable part of my following Lectures, wherein I shall indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to shew the admirable contrivance and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of this Method of our Salvation. But as a foundation to this, I think it necessary to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course first of the other <hi>two,</hi> and that as briefly and plainly as I can.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the <hi>first,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> to consider who the Persons are, whom Christ Jesus came to save.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle calls them <hi>Sinners;</hi> that is in other words, They are Men, Creatures compos'd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Souls, and Bodies of Flesh, who were formed after the Image of God, and were innocent and upright as they came out of his hands; but had apostatized from their Maker, violating their Allegiance to him, and thereby disordering their Natures, and exposing themselves to the just dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God, with the miserable effects and consequences thereof. Now I think it may very much conduce to our present Design, to shew that these Creatures were really fit Objects of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great Concern and Tenderness express'd towards them by their Maker, through his Son Jesus Christ; that considering their original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52618:21"/>together with the manner and the effect of their falling from it, it was highly becoming the good God thus to appear in their behalf.</p>
                  <p>It must be acknowledg'd, and why should we be shy of owning it? Nay we Christians justly glory in it, that the Method of our Salvation by the Gospel is the most surprizing thing that falls within the compass of humane thought.

                  <p>'Tis an unworthy thought of God, to suspect that he should disregard any thing which he thought fit to make. The giving Being to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was without all doubt the effect of his meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now of all the Creatures in this lower World, there are none that pretend to vye with Man, for excellency and dignity of Nature: nay if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider Humane Nature thorowly, we shall find it endued with such Faculties, as that we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there are any Creatures more excellent in kind, though in degree there may, in the Regions above.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52618:22"/>
                  <p>Men have Bodies indeed form'd out of the Dust of the Earth, like the other Animals that dwell upon Earth, though in Shape and Portraiture more noble much than any of them: but with respect to their Souls,
<note place="margin">Psal. 8.5.</note> they are <hi>made a little lower than the Angels,</hi> being <hi>created in the Image,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note>
                     <hi>and after the likeness of God,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> expresseth it. And of this we may be satisfied, besides the Testimony of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Psalmist, by viewing our selves, and observing the present Ruins of a once more stately Fabrick.</p>
                  <p>The Resemblance of our Maker appears evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Natural Faculties, and much more in our Moral. Our Souls are invisible indeed, but evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifest their Being by their various Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. They inhabit these Bodies in such manner, as to influence and govern every part of them. They do at pleasure move each Joint and Limb, nay the whole Body at once, without difficulty, in a moment, and by the power of a single thought. They not only manage the Tab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nacles they dwell in, but by their means also have communication with a world of Beings without them. By the mediation of the Senses they take in continual No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices from all the material Objects within a certain Sphere. They see, and hear, and feel whatsoever makes a near approach to them, nay they reach to things at a vast distance from them. They do not confine their Observations to the Earth and Air; but view at once the vast circumference of the Heavens, and pry into the Bodies that are plac'd in those distant Regions. They not only receive and take in Notices by the mediation of the Senses;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52618:23"/>but form Ideas of their own of various kinds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, compounding, dividing, either according to the nature of things, or at their own pleasure. They can reflect upon what is past, nay recollect what they have forgot, and foresee things yet to come. They can stretch and extend their thoughts till they are quite lost in the oceans of Immensity and Eternity. They acquaint themselves not only with the material part of the World, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material also. From contemplating themselves, they enlarge their thoughts to other Beings of the same kind. They discern the Spirits of other Men through the veil of their Bodies, and find out and contemplate an unknown and innumerable number of Spiritual Natures, till at last they ascend to God himself, that infinite Spirit, who was the Maker and is the Preserver of all.</p>
                  <p>And here we are arrived at the top of their knowledge. Not that the Souls of Men are able to comprehend the Nature of that first and most excellent Being; but they can make such discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Divine Perfections, as will naturally produce in them an high Admiration, a profound Reverence, and an ardent Love towards the Deity, and will incline and dispose them to adore and serve him, to resign themselves to him, and to yield a ready obedience to his Commands.</p>
                  <p>And what those Commands are, the Soul is in some measure also capacitated to discern, infering its Duty from the consideration of its own nature, and the relation it stands in to God, and to its fellow-creatures.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52618:23"/>
                  <p>And, which is yet an higher Perfection than meer Knowledge, the Souls of Men can perceive the Will of God, and consequently their own Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from certain secret inclinations and propensions which they feel within themselves, and of which they are apprehensive even in this degenerate state. That natural regard to God, and looking towards him upon all Emergencies, that approbation of Justice and Kindness between Man and Man, especially that gratitude for benefits receiv'd, and unavoidable commiseration towards miserable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which are to be found in most Men, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd in a more than common degree, are plain and undeniable Instances of this kind, which will not be controverted by those to whom I am offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Considerations, and for which I may be allow'd to appeal to the far greater part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And I question not, but the like might be observ'd, as to most other plain and considerable instances of Moral Vertue. For which reason it is, that the Consciences of Men do so naturally and universally either accuse or excuse them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they contradict or comply with, not barely the reasonings, but the natural apprehensions and inclinations of their Minds.</p>
                  <p>And this indeed I take to be the Perfection of the Humane Soul, as it came out of the hands of God, that it had a capacity not only of knowing God, and it self, and of inferring its Duty by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising its Reason: but that it was also made to resemble the Divine Nature in its inclinations and propensions to all that is good; which inclinations and propensions, had they been cherish'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52618:24"/>as they might and ought to have been, would have fully discover'd the dignity of Humane Nature, and made Men to have appear'd, what God by their make design'd them to be.</p>
                  <p>There is yet one Ability more, with which the Humane Soul is endued, not to be past over, when we are considering the excellency of its Nature, and that is Freedom or Liberty of choosing, and a Power consequently of acting according to such choice, without which its Liberty would have been given to it in vain.</p>
                  <p>But shall I call this a Perfection, or an Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</p>
                  <p>As it is a Power of freely choosing that which is good, and as freely pursuing that choice, it must be thankfully acknowledg'd to the praise of our bountiful Creator, that it is a Perfection, even whereby we are made to resemble God himself, who always freely chooseth and acteth according to the eternal and immutable Laws of Goodness. 'Tis a Talent of great worth, with which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is entrusted, and which may be improv'd to very great advantage. It gives us an Ability of offering to God a free-will Offering, of voluntarily doing that which is acceptable to, and rewardable by our Maker. 'Tis that which indeed makes us, strictly speaking, capable of a Reward.</p>
                  <p>But then as Men can at the same time choose that which is Evil, and pursue the unhappy choice, it must be own'd to be an Imperfection; but such an one as seems necessarily to result from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Creature. Absolute Perfection belongs to God only; his Nature is too good ever to choose
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52618:24"/>or act amiss: but the condition of a Creature is to be defectible of its self; so that if it be made capable of choosing aright, it must at the same time also be capable of choosing wrong. Liberty implies a Power to determine its choice one way or the other; and there is no such absolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in a Creature, as can always necessarily oblige it to determine it self the right way. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Use may produce strong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Habits of Virtue; and the Grace of God may at any time put a Creature out of all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but I cannot see, how 'tis possible to frame an Idea of a created Agent left at Liberty, but it must at the same time be fallible and mutable. But this may suffice to shew the dignity of the Humane Soul with respect to its Liberty, that it is made capable of choosing and acting freely by the same Rules by which God himself chooseth and acteth.</p>
                  <p>And had Men always acted, according to the design of their Beings, the excellency of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have plainly appear'd in a whole world of intelligent and reasonable Agents, exercising all the Faculties before-mention'd regularly and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; acknowledging, adoring, magnifying, and serving their Maker; admiring his wonderful Works, and rendering to him with one consent the Praises due upon the account of them; living in perfect Amity one with another; discharging readily all the Offices of Beneficence; performing and enjoying all the Benefits and Pleasures of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Society; and deriving from Heaven all those Blessings which would have render'd their abode
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52618:25"/>here perfectly easie and comfortable; and if God should have thought it fit to have translated them to any superiour Regions, as a reward of their Obedience here, they would there also have spent a happy Eternity, in the Enjoyment of their Maker, themselves, and one another.</p>
                  <p>I mention their translation to some other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, because all those Powers of Soul which I have been discoursing of, imply nothing but what is immaterial and spiritual, and consequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; and if Men had used their Liberty aright in this state of tryal, it is not to be conceiv'd, that God would have permitted the corruption of the Body; but rather have preserv'd for ever that Union which himself had given to the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive parts of Humane Nature, and have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd them such places of residence as might have been fit for Men improv'd and confirm'd in Virtue and Goodness.</p>
                  <p>What I have hitherto been discoursing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of Mankind, appears to me in it self highly reasonable, and I think will do so upon serious consideration, to such a Deist as I am ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing with: and if so; I would then proceed to ask, whether such Creatures as these are not fit Objects of the Divine Care; and if they are fallen, of the Divine Compassion also, supposing any of them capable of a Recovery from their lapsed Estate? Will it not appear very worthy of the infinitely good God, to concern himself in some extraordinary way, for the restoration and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Beings, whom he had form'd after this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner, to whom he had imparted so many
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52618:25"/>of his own Perfections in such a degree, and whom he had made capable of being for ever happy in his Favour?</p>
                  <p>But for the farther illustration of this matter,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we may in the next place consider the Persons whom Christ Jesus came to save, as they are in their fallen state, <hi>Sinners,</hi> as our Text calls them, and see whether under that denomination also, they are not proper Objects of the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, even in such a degree as it is express'd by the undertaking of our Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>The Method of our Salvation by Jesus Christ is so contrived (as I hope to shew hereafter) as not only to testifie the Compassion of God towards Sinners; but also his Hatred of Sin: To make it appear therefore that such a Method was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Divine Nature, we shall do well to consider the condition of Men, as <hi>Sinners;</hi> to which purpose it may be proper,</p>
                  <p>To take into consideration the nature of Sin.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>To observe the miserable consequences of it to Mankind. And,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>To inquire how Men were drawn into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of it.

                  </p>
                  <p>To take into consideration the nature of Sin.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doubt not but those, who undervalue our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour's Undertaking for the recovery of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, have at the same time very slight apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the evil of Sin. They are apt to account it a matter of no great consideration or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for so inconsiderable a Creature as they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52618:26"/>would have Man to be, to gratifie (suppose) the inclinations of his fleshly part, though against the Dictates of his Mind, and the Laws of his Maker. But this proceeds from their want of a due sense of the nature and reason of things.</p>
                  <p>For to sin against God, is for a Creature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against his Creator and Preserver; 'tis to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Will to the Will of the supreme Lord and Sovereign of the Universe; 'tis to disturb that excellent Order, which is appointed and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by him who made all things very good; 'tis for a Man to assume to himself a Liberty of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which God will not allow himself to do, namely to vary from the eternal and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Laws of Truth and Goodness, those Laws which result necessarily from the Nature of God, and the condition of created Beings; 'tis resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the highest Power; contradicting unerring Wisdom; disobliging infinite Goodness; making disingenuous and ungrateful Returns to the most endearing Obligations; 'tis in a word thwarting the true judgment and perverting the natural byass of a Man's own Mind, and acting contrary to the very frame and design of his Nature.</p>
                  <p>Now whatsoever is absurd or monstrous in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are apt to conceive an abhorrence at the first appearance of it: and whosoever is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Moral Principles ought in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to feel a detestation arising in his Soul, when he considers the nature of Sin, as I have here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented it.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52618:26"/>
                  <p>Doth not every ingenuous and well-disposed Mind severely censure and detest the untoward behaviour of a graceless Child towards a wise and tender Parent? The unworthy carriage of a rebellious Subject, towards a just and kind Prince, one who is truly the Father of his Country? Especially when the Rebel not only dishonours his Superiors, but at the same time disturbs the Peace and good Order of the whole Community? Do not all Men of good sense and honest disposition abhor him who shall make spightful or ungrateful returns to a Benefactor, or a Friend, to whom he has been extremely beholden? Who is there that does not despise the Man that degrades and vilifies himself, by doing things altogether unworthy of his Birth, and Education, or Profession?</p>
                  <p>Why all this, and infinitely more is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Sin voluntarily committed against Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
                  <p>And is it not credible then, that so holy and good a Being as God is, should be inclin'd to save such of his Creatures as are capable of Salvation, from so great an Evil? and that he should effect it in such a way, as may convince them at once both of his compassion towards them, and his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of their evil doings?</p>
                  <p>But to render this the more evident,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we may in the next place observe the miserable consequences of Sin to Mankind; and that, either in any single Sinner apart, or in the mass and bulk of Mankind in general.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52618:27"/>
                  <p>The state of every particular Sinner is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miserable. A Man has no sooner consented to Iniquity, but he is naturally fill'd with great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness of Mind, arising from Shame and Fear, from a consciousness of having done an unworthy act, and an apprehension of the Mischiefs that may follow.</p>
                  <p>The very first Act is a mighty Disorder, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an abuse of that Liberty with which he was entrusted, and a contradiction to that natural inclination with which he was endued by his Maker.</p>
                  <p>By this means the tone of his Spirit is (as it were) immediately relax'd; the Will corrupted; the natural propension of the Soul towards God and Goodness weaken'd, and a contrary disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perhaps introduc'd; the Appetites and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which were made to be rul'd, having once broke loose from the Government they were plac'd under, are apt thence-forward to become impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and arbitrary; the Understanding having been once mislead or over rul'd, is for the future less able to discern clearly, or to judge Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; in a word, Innocency and Integrity are lost.</p>
                  <p>Every repeated Act strengthens the evil Habit, and increases the disorder which is thus unhappily begun in all the Faculties.</p>
                  <p>If the Man continues to be a Sinner only in a lower degree, he will find a perpetual struggle and conflict within his breast, his Understanding, and Reason, and Conscience directing and leading
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52618:27"/>him one way, whilst his Appetites and Passions hurry him the other,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note>
                     <hi>the Law in his Members war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring against the Law in his Mind,</hi> and for the most part <hi>bringing him into Captivity;</hi> he neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving what he does, nor finding himself at all dispos'd to do what he approves; <hi>wretched Man that he is!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if he be grown a harden'd Sinner, he is still the more <hi>wretched,</hi> because more incurable; though at the same time less sensible of his evil condition.</p>
                  <p>And all this while he is exceedingly estrang'd and alienated from God, the Author of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Fountain of all Good; he is asham'd and afraid to approach to him, upon whom he intirely depends, or to address himself to him whose aid he stands in need of every moment; he is conscious of having given him offence, and therefore justly apprehends his displeasure.</p>
                  <p>This is livelily represented by <hi>Moses,</hi> in the case of our first Parents,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.8, 9, 10.</note> who immediately upon their disobeying the Command of God, hid themselves from his face, being asham'd and afraid to see or hear of him, whom just before they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with to their great satisfaction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And every Sinner, that is not past feeling, may find something very like this within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p>This is the natural state of Sin; besides the consequences which may also follow from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of Almighty God, who, we see, even in this World hath made us sensible of his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52618:28"/>by the many Evils we are necessarily expos'd to, during a short Life, such as Disappointments, Wants, Sickness, Pain, Sorrows and Miseries of various kinds; and at last Death it self, with the very <hi>fear</hi> of which most Men are <hi>all their life time subject to bondage.</hi> All these Evils the Scriptures assure us are the results of Sin; and even without Revelation, upon the meer Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Morality, I cannot see how we can judge otherwise.</p>
                  <p>And besides all this, the Soul (as I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice before) being apprehensive of its own Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Immortal Nature, cannot but forebode the perpetual continuance of its present infelicity, with the additiono f it knows not what Evils in some future state of things, the very forethought of which must be very terrible to it even in this Life.</p>
                  <p>And if we can observe so much Misery in the condition of a particular Sinner, how much more shall we discover, if we enlarge our thoughts to the whole mass of Mankind?</p>
                  <p>If we might be allow'd to take our view from the History of <hi>Moses,</hi> it would give us a very melancholy prospect. The very first Man that was born into the World fell into no less a Crime, than that of imbruing his hands in the blood of his innocent Brother.

                     <hi>and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the sequel of that History we find that soon after the Flood, the World was again corrupted in a prodigious manner, in so much that in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> within little more than Four Hundred Years, Idolatry had spread it self so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally, as to have infected even the Family of <hi>Shem,</hi> so that God thought fit to call forth <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> from his Country and his Kindred, in order to the preserving him and his Posterity in the Worship of the one true God, the Maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. And if Idolatry had thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, we may conclude that other Crimes were no less rife; forsaking of God being the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other Evil.</p>
                  <p>If, laying aside the History of <hi>Moses,</hi> we should consider the state of Mankind, according to all other accounts given of it, it will still come to the same issue, namely that the generality of Men were soon degenerated into the most unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and unnatural practices that can be thought of.</p>
                  <p>The representation which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes of the Pagan World, was undoubtedly true,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21,</note> that <hi>they were become vain in their imaginations, having their foolish hearts darken'd;</hi>

                  <p>There were indeed some few to be found, even in the midst of all this Corruption, who had not forsaken God, and degenerated into Vice, in so heinous a degree; the Principles of natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52618:29"/>having in some measure prevail'd with them: but these were very rarely to be met with.</p>
                  <p>There was, it's true, a small Body of Men, the <hi>Jews</hi> I mean, whom God had by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Providence taken out of the mass of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in order to instruct and educate them in better manner. But even these were very hardly kept to the observance of those Laws which God had given them. They easily and frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into Idolatry, and the other evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of their Neighbours; and when after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Captivity they were at last cur'd of their Idolatry, yet after all they generally attain'd to but very mean apprehensions either of God, or of the nature of Religion; they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the most part with the observance of the ritual part of their Law, whilst the <hi>two great Commandments</hi> both of their Law, and of all true Religion, <hi>the Love of God and their Neighbour,</hi> were grosly neglected by them; in so much that when our Saviour appear'd amongst them, he found the greater part of them as indispos'd to receive him and his Doctrine, as the Gentiles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, God had not left Mankind, not the rest of the World, much less the <hi>Jews,</hi> without various means proper for the preserving of them from these Corruptions. <hi>He taught</hi> all Men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways, as I shew'd in my former Discourse, though they did not <hi>hear and learn</hi> of him. But this was still an aggravation of their Misery, that all the Methods of Divine Providence for their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52618:30"/>good had been frustrated and render'd ineffectual by them.</p>
                  <p>And was not this a deplorable state, and such as might well move a God of infinite Goodness to find out and appoint some more effectual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, for the recovery of this his ruin'd Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Could he, do we think, look on, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the great Enemy both of himself and his Creation, thus insulting and triumphing; the most excellent Creature he had in this lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion thus abus'd and spoil'd; and as the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof the whole inferiour Creation in disorder and confusion; and not interpose in some extraordinary and surprizing manner? But this will still appear more becoming the Divine Nature, if we enquire, in the last place,</p>
                  <p>How Men were drawn into the commission of Sin. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The case, as represented by <hi>Moses,</hi> which is what the Christian Revelation takes for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was certainly very compassionable. That our first Parents were set upon, whilst they were as yet unexperienc'd, by a subtil and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Enemy, who made his attacks first upon the weaker Sex, and by her prevail'd upon the Man, inveigling them by a sly and false Suggestion, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially represented, making use of their sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Powers to bafflle their intellectual, imposing upon their Understandings by craft and confidence, and perswading them on a sudden, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting either God or their own Reason, to do a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52618:30"/>rash and dangerous Act, by which they expos'd both themselves and their Posterity to all the evil consequences, which either naturally or judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially follow'd.</p>
                  <p>But waving this (though without considering it as a Divine Revelation, it is most reasonable to suppose that the general Corruption of Humane Nature began in some such way) waving this I say, and taking Humane Nature as it appears, the circumstances of Sinners will still seem very compassionable.</p>
                  <p>For although Man was without Question made upright, yet being endued with Liberty, he must at the very best, (as I before observ'd) be fallible and mutable. His immaterial Spirit is join'd to a Body of Flesh, and plac'd in the midst of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of sensible Objects, that it may be capable of a Tryal; and though it might have many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in its uncorrupt state, which at present it wants, yet still it was lyable to be impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and drawn in.</p>
                  <p>Those who first sin'd may very well be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have done it, before their good Habits were confirm'd by Experience and Use, and that consequently there was somewhat of surprize, as well as some degree of inconsiderateness and rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the action. And those who have since grown up, (as all but our first Parents must have done) from a state of infancy, are still in harder circumstances. Their Bodily Tempers, which have a great influence upon the Mind, can be no better than what their Parents could communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52618:31"/>Their Senses are for many years busily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd, before their Reason is thorowly awake. They are surrounded with all manner of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and they see abundance of dangerous Examples in a degenerate World. They are for a long time weak and unexperienc'd; and many of them over and above betray'd by an untoward or a careless Education.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, not one of all these Considerations will excuse the Sinner, and that for this plain Reason; because the first Sinner, whoever he was, being suppos'd to be made upright, 'tis not to be conceiv'd he could have fallen, but by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting to depend upon his Maker, and apply himself to him. For an intellectual Creature not to depend upon God, and apply it self to him upon all occasions, is an inexcusable fault; and had those who first consented to Iniquity done but thus much, 'tis very reasonable to believe, that the God who made them, would have afforded them his assistance. Nay (as I hope to shew in the progress of these Discourses) even now, under all the disadvantages we are born into the World and brought up with, God hath made such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision through Jesus Christ, that nothing but a wilful and unaccountable neglect of God can ruin us. Here began the Apostacy and the Misery of Mankind, and in the same way they are still continued, <hi>viz.</hi> in Mens neglecting to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and look up to that God who never forsakes any of his Creatures, till they first forsake him. So that what I have alleged under this last head,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52618:31"/>does not excuse the Sinner: but yet (which is what I alleged it for) it renders his case exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly compassionable to a God of infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>The summe of all I have said upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, that <hi>this is a credible saying, that Christ Jesus came into the World to save Sinners.</hi> For if <hi>Sinners</hi> be such Creatures as I have represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, both before and since their Apostacy, it cannot but be <hi>credible,</hi> that he who made them should appoint some way for their Recovery. And though we could not be fully assur'd of this without a Revelation, much less could have thought of the Method which it hath pleased God to take; yet as we might naturally hope, that God would extend his compassion to us; so we have all the reason in the World readily to accept a Revelation which assures us, that God hath done it.</p>
                  <p>What the Way and Method of our Salvation is, our Text tells us, and this will fall under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration in my following Discourses.</p>
                  <p>I am sensible there is one Objection, which, upon hearing the present Discourse may arise in the Minds of Men who think seriously, and are not dispos'd to cavil, <hi>viz.</hi> If the case of Humane Nature be so deplorable and compassionable, how comes it to pass, that so small a part of Mankind have receiv'd benefit even from the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation? This Difficulty I would have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in this Lecture, if there had been room for it; but being prevented, I shall not forget it;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52618:32"/>but assign it some fit place, if God please, before my Lectures are finish'd, intending in my next, to proceed in considering the nature of that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which our Saviour hath wrought out for us, and the manner in which he hath done it, whereby the <hi>Credibility</hi> of this saying in the Text may yet farther appear.</p>

                        <p>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the World, to save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, —</p>
                     </q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IN treating on these Words, I propos'd, by God's Assistance, to make good the Apostle's assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Saying mention'd by him is both certainly true, and fit to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by us with all readiness and thankfulness; and <hi>that,</hi> whether we consider the intrinsick Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it carries along with it, or the external At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation which hath been given to it.</p>
                  <p>I began with its intrinsick Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> its credibility from its manifest agreeableness to those Notions which we naturally have concerning God and our selves. And to make this appear, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the following Method.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>

                     <item>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In what way and manner he hath, by his <hi>coming into the world,</hi> wrought out this <hi>Salvation</hi> for them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these I have dispatch'd, shewing, that the Persons, whom <hi>Christ Jesus came into the VVorld to save,</hi> were both <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> under each of which denominations, I endeavour'd to make it appear, that they were fit Objects of the Divine Care and Compassion to be exercised in some extraordinary manner.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to consider in the <hi>second</hi> place, what kind of Salvation Christ Jesus proposeth to these Creatures, concerning which I shall not need to add much, after what hath been discours'd upon the former head. For by a little reflection upon the condition of Sinners, 'twill be easie to discern, what kind of Salvation they stood in need of, which is the very same, which our Saviour hath propos'd to us in his Gospel, his design in coming into the World being to provide for the necessities of fallen Men; with reference to which Necessities <hi>Salvation</hi> must imply both a Deliverance from those many Evils, to which Sin had exposed them; and a Restitution of those many Blessings, which by their transgression they had forfeited.</p>
                  <p>Thus for Instance; The <hi>Salvation</hi> of Men by Jesus Christ consists in his delivering them from the just displeasure of their Maker, and all the terrible Effects of it; together with a complete Restorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them to the Divine favour, and giving them a Title to all those Blessings which are proper for humane Nature, when accepted of God; in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52618:36"/>setting them free from all that disorder and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity which had been introduc'd into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Faculties of their Souls, together with the dissatisfaction and uneasiness of Mind which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follow'd, as also from those inconveniencies and miseries to which their Bodies likewise were expos'd, either as a consequence or a punishment of the corruption of their Minds; in restoring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly that frame and temper of Spirit, which is natural to an intelligent and reasonable Creature, together with that healthful and vigorous state of Body, that sound constitution of the whole Man, which would have been the Effect or the Reward of Innocency and Integrity.</p>
                  <p>In a word, <hi>Salvation</hi> consists in reconciling God to Men, and Men to God, and in all the blessed Fruits of such a Reconciliation; which how many and how great they will be, we are not able in this imperfect State so much as to conjecture. This will be best understood, by such as shall partake of this Salvation, when it shall be fully accomplished: In the mean time, it may satisfie and encourage us to believe, that they will bear a proportion to the Bounty of God, and the Capacities of Men.</p>
                  <p>And as this is the <hi>Salvation,</hi> which the Gospel offereth to every particular Man to whom it is Preach'd, so it assures us, that all those who shall embrace the offer, shall be thus saved; and that the consequence of this will be a Renovation of this part of the World, which has been so miserably disorder'd by the Sins of Men, a Restitution of whatsoever has been decay'd in it, the expelling sin and misery out of it, the subduing and confining
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52618:37"/>the great Enemy of God and Man, who has so long usurp'd dominion over it,

                     <note place="margin">22.</note>into <hi>a glorious Liberty;</hi> in a word,

                  <p>All this is so evidently propos'd by the Gospel of our Saviour, as the design of his Undertaking, and so expresly and fully declar'd thereby, that I need not spend time in producing any particular Proofs.</p>
                  <p>And all this is without question highly worthy of so great and so good a Being as God is.</p>
                  <p>Had the Christian Revelation told us, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God had sent his only-begotten Son from Heaven, only to secure to us the pleasures of the <hi>Elysian</hi> Fields, or a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Paradice, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for us a full and perpetual Enjoyment of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Entertainments and Delights; whosoever had any just thoughts of the divine, or humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, might reasonably have disputed, nay boldly denyed the divinity of such a Revelation. But when on the contrary it assures us, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our came into the World with such noble and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52618:37"/>designs as these, to cause the displeasure of God to cease, to heal the diseases of immaterial and immortal Spirits, to repair the divine Image in them, to restore both them and the Tabernacles they sojourn'd in to their primitive Integrity and Soundness, to repair the ruins of Nature, to make the Beauties of the Creation in this lower World conspicuous, to destroy the Works of the Devil, to recover such of God's Creatures as should be found capable of a Recovery, to introduce and settle E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Righteousness and Peace, and finally to make a considerable number of the children of Men Eternally happy in the Enjoyment of their Maker; these are all of them things so well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Majesty and the Benignity of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Father, and his only-begotten Son, and at the same time so beneficial and grateful to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, that we have all the reason in the World to hearken to such a Revelation as this, and to be well dispos'd to receive it as coming from God.</p>
                  <p>And this again renders the <hi>Saying</hi> in the Text still more <hi>credible,</hi> when we thus consider what kind of <hi>Salvation</hi> that is, which <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> offereth to <hi>Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But because the main stress, with respect to the intrinsick Evidence of this <hi>Saying,</hi> will lie upon what I have to offer upon the <hi>third</hi> general Head I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, I therefore proceed to that, designing to insist more largely and particularly upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> to consider in what way and manner <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> by his <hi>coming into the world</hi> hath wrought out this <hi>Salvation</hi> for <hi>Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52618:38"/>
                  <p>The Nature of <hi>Man,</hi> and the condition of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> as you have heard, make it credible, that God should concern himself for their Recovery. 'Tis also credible, that if Almighty God should offer <hi>Salvation</hi> to Men, it would be such a kind of Salvation as I have been describing: But besides all this, the Method in which our Lord hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Salvation for us is so excellent in it self, so suitable to the nature of things, so agreeable to all just apprehensions both concerning God and our selves, so well accommodated to our necessities and our reasonable desires, that I am verily perswaded, nothing but a want of understanding it can occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion any reasonable man to hesitate at the belief of it.</p>
                  <p>I am very sensible, before I enter upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that we ignorant and weak Creatures are not able to account for the Works of our Maker. Even the least of his Works in Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence infinitely exceeds our Comprehension; and much more the wonders of our Redemption by Jesus Christ. We are not capable of diving into all the depths of this admirable Dispensation, nor of spying out all the reasons and excellencies of it. But yet so much we may discern, as may cause us justly to admire and adore the divine Perfections display'd therein, and may strongly incline us to believe the Divinity of this Revelation, even before we come to consider the external Attestation which it hath receiv'd from God. This therefore is next in order to be done, <hi>viz.</hi> to contemplate the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in which <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> by his <hi>coming into the world saveth Sinners,</hi> and with Modesty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52618:38"/>to inquire into the Way and Manner of our <hi>Salvation</hi> by the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Now the most comprehensive Notion we can frame to our selves of our blessed Saviour's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking is, that he acted as a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Men; and therefore by considering what the Office of a <hi>Mediator</hi> is, and how our Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted that Office, we shall be the better able to understand the Method of our Salvation by him.</p>
                  <p>That our Lord sustein'd the Character of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> is evident from the account we have of his Undertaking, throughout the Scriptures. Those Persons, who in the Old Testament are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd as Types and Representatives of the Messiah, were divers of them a sort of <hi>Mediators</hi> between God and the People of <hi>Israel. Moses</hi> the great Lawgiver of the <hi>Jews</hi> was apparently a Figure of Christ in this respect; as he managed all affairs between God and that People, receiving and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Messages from God to them, and again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting their Addresses to God, and frequently making supplications on their behalf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle gives him this Title,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> when he says, that <hi>the Law was ordain'd by Angels, in the hands of a Mediator,</hi> meaning <hi>Moses.</hi> The <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Priests were so many Types of our Lord, as they were a sort of <hi>Mediators</hi> between God and the <hi>Israelites,</hi> being appointed to expound the Law of God to them, to bless them in his Name, and to offer up Sacrifices together with Prayers and Praises to God upon their account. Their High-Priest had in an eminent manner this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, exercising the <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Function, as a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52618:39"/>special representative of the Messiah, when he went <hi>alone once every year</hi> into the <hi>second Tabernacle,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>As to the New Testament, it may seem super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to recite from thence any particular Proofs, that our Saviour acted as a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Men; 'tis his Character throughout that Volume.

                     <hi>There is,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, One God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Christ Jesus.</hi> The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> making a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison between the High-Priests under the Law, and our great High-Priest under the Gospel, saith of him,
<note place="margin">Heb. 8.6.</note> that <hi>he hath obtain'd a more excellent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi> than theirs, <hi>by how much also he is the Mediator of a better Covenant.</hi> He calls him again more than once,

                     <hi>by him;</hi> in which words he evidently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the <hi>one Lord</hi> or <hi>Mediator</hi> of Christians, to the <hi>many Lords,</hi> or <hi>Mediators</hi> of the Gentiles, mention'd in the preceding Verse; and in saying that <hi>all things,</hi> particularly <hi>we</hi> Christians are <hi>by him,</hi> he plainly gives him the Character of a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What the Office of a <hi>Mediator</hi> is, we all know, <hi>viz.</hi> to make up a difference between two Parties,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52618:39"/>and in order to that, equitably and impartially to consider the real Interests and the just pretensions on each side, and to transact matters so, that both may be satisfied; that if any injury has been done, it may, as far as 'tis possible, be repaired; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever displeasure has been conceiv'd may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd; that whatsoever mischief has been produc'd, it may be prevented for the future; in a word, that all things may be managed suitably to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and agreeably to the expectation of the Parties concern'd.</p>
                  <p>But before we come to consider the particular way and manner in which our great <hi>Mediator</hi> hath discharg'd this his Undertaking, it may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss first to shew in the general, that it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreeable both to the nature of God, and of fallen Man, that there should be a <hi>Mediator</hi> to transact this great affair of reconciling this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Creature to his Maker.</p>
                  <p>That this hath been the general Apprehension of Mankind, that it becomes us to approach to God by a <hi>Mediator,</hi> is fully evident from all the Records of antient and almost universal Practice. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52618:40"/>he takes it for granted it was of the utmost Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and venerable upon that account, as well as reasonable in it self.

But be that as it will; what I at present insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that this is agreeable to the natural Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of Mankind; insomuch that though the Pagan Theologers exceedingly err'd in appointing to themselves Mediators, whom God never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor could approve; yet they had good ground for conceiving a <hi>Mediator</hi> necessary, at least highly expedient, between the divine Majesty, and the sinful children of Men. It ought not to pass for a Mistake or a Prejudice taken up without reason; but for a natural and just apprehension, as will plainly appear, if we contemplate the Perfection of the divine Nature, or the Imperfection of our own.</p>

                  <p>We conceive of God, as a pure Spirit, Eternal, Incomprehensible, Infinite in all Perfection: We feel our selves dependent, indigent, weak Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, at an infinite distance from him who made us. And although, if we had retain'd our Native Integrity, the consideration of the divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and our own Innocency, might have embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd us to approach to him with freedom: yet being farther apprehensive of his infinite Purity, and intimately conscious of our Apostacy from him, and the impurity and disorder we have contracted thereby, we must needs be asham'd and afraid to approach to him of our selves, and we cannot but wish that we could meet with some Person worthy and fit to mediate between him and us, who would be so kind as to offer us his Assistance, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us again into his Presence and Favor.</p>
                  <p>This was that, (as I took notice in my former Lecture) which, according to the account of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.8.</note> caus'd our first Parents to hide themselves from the face of God, and tremble when they heard his voice, as soon as ever they were consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of having transgress'd his Law, and thereupon felt themselves naked. And 'tis the very same thing, which makes every Sinner, instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and returning to God, be apt still to run farther from him; his guilt, as well as his corrupt inclination, rendering him shy of approaching to him, or hoping in him. For although, what I have before observ'd is true, <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis both natural and reasonable to hope, that so good a Being as God is, would find out some way, for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52618:41"/>the Recovery of such Creatures as fallen Men are; yet 'tis as natural and reasonable to be fill'd with shame and Fear, in the sense of having offended this great and good Being, and to wish that some one might be found out to interpose between him and us. And therefore <hi>Job</hi> speaks the language of Nature, who, though he were as apprehensive as any Man of the divine Goodness, and conscious of his own Integrity in the main; yet considering the greatness of God's Majesty, and his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, both as a Man, and a Sinner, and at present in great distress,
<note place="margin">Job 9.32, 33.</note> he makes this a part of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>He is not a Man, as I am, that I should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer him, and we should come together in judgment; neither is there any Days-man</hi> (the Septuagint uses the very word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Mediator) between us, who might lay his hand upon us both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this is really the sense of Nature, may yet farther appear, in that amongst Men it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reputed fit and decent, and the properest Method for attaining our end, that an Inferior, who has injured or disoblig'd his Superior, should attempt a Reconciliation, by the interposal of some third Person well known to them both. If a Child by gross Neglect or wilful Disobedience has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd the displeasure of a Parent, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his knowledge and experience of his Parents Affection and Tenderness, 'tis very natural for him to desire some good Friend, who has an Interest in his Parent, and is more his equal, to mediate in his behalf. If a Subject has rebell'd against his Prince, and thereby dishonor'd and offended him, be the Prince never so famous for his goodness
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52618:41"/>and clemency, yet the Rebel is naturally afraid to approach him, without the intercession of some prevalent Friend at Court. And in each of these Cases, both the Father and the Prince judge it to be more fit and decent, they better like and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this manner of proceeding, than if the undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Child or Subject should boldly and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intrude themselves into their presence. And it is lookt upon by all, as more for the Honor of the Superior, as well as the satisfaction of the Inferior, that this course should be taken. It doth right to the one, by rendering his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity more awful for the future; as well as it relieves the other, by affording him assistance suitable to his distress, and agreeable to his wishes.</p>
                  <p>And if it be thus amongst Men, why should it not much more be thought a reasonable way of proceeding between the great and holy God, and his apostate Creatures; when the universal Parent hath been disoblig'd by his Offspring, and the Supreme Lord of all disobey'd by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?</p>
                  <p>There is not indeed upon all accounts the same use of a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Men, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one Man and another. A Mediator between Men may be often necessary to remove unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Prejudices; to rectifie Mistakes and Misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, which may have been taken up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause; or to allay inordinate Passions, which may have been raised on one side as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But in God, none of these things can be conceiv'd; He can have no unreasonable Prejudices
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52618:42"/>against his Creatures; no Misapprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; no inordinate Passions with respect to them: but still it may be for the honor of God, and consequently to his satisfaction; as well as for the benefit of the Sinner, that a <hi>Mediator</hi> should interpose between them, as I shall presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shew more fully. Thus much I thought fit to premise with respect to this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of our Salvation in the general, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew the agreeableness and fitness of our Saviour's sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining the Character of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> both with respect to God and Man.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to consider more particularly, the way in which our Saviour hath executed this Office, according as the Gospel represents the matter, and to evince, that upon this account also, <hi>This is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Saying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>According to the account I have already given of the Office of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> there must be these two general Designs, which our Saviour must be suppos'd to have carried on in the Execution of it.</p>

                     <item>To do also whatsoever should be found neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in behalf of fallen Men,

                  <p>To do whatsoever might satisfie Almighty God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in order to his being reconcil'd to fallen Men.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52618:42"/>
                  <p>Almighty God, both as he is a Being infinitely greater than his Creatures, and as he was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son offended, ought first to be consider'd in the Mediation, which was to be transacted; and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing should be found necessary, or highly expedient to be done, in order to the giving him just Satisfaction in the case, this in all reason should be a principal part of the Mediator's care.</p>
                  <p>Now as to this, some perhaps might be apt to think, that nothing more could be requisite towards the giving Satisfaction to God, than the bringing the fallen Creature to Repentance and Amendment. For what can in reason be expected from a weak and fallible Creature, such as Man is, who was drawn into Sin in the manner I have before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, but that he should become throughly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of his folly and guilt, humbly make his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to his Creator, and for the future endeavour to behave himself better? And how can we suppose, that a God of infinite Goodness, should not take this as full Satisfaction from his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
                  <p>This by a first and superficial view of the case, some men may be apt to imagine: but if they would look more thorowly into it, and consider the matter to the bottom, they might easily see reason to alter their Judgments.</p>
                  <p>I readily allow, that this is all that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Sinner, 'tis all he can do on his part, and a God of infinite goodness will no doubt approve of such his behaviour: but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, there may be something farther ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52618:43"/>or at least highly fit to be done for the honor of Almighty God, and which he may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determine shall be done for his Satisfaction, before he will enter upon new Terms with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate Creature.</p>
                  <p>For instance; There are two of the divine Attributes, to which more especially Honor ought to be done in this case, namely the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God, and his <hi>Justice</hi> as Governor of the World.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holiness</hi> of God.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Epithet <hi>Holy</hi> is frequently annexed to the sacred Name of God in Scripture, under which are comprehended all the Moral Perfections of the divine Nature, particularly his entire love of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and his irreconcileable hatred of all Evil, or Sin. Hence he is said by the Prophet, to be <hi>of purer Eyes than to behold evil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Habak. 1.13.</note> and that <hi>he cannot look on iniquity.</hi> He is frequently represented as <hi>hating sin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. 5.4, 5.</note> and even <hi>the workers of iniquity,</hi> for their works sake; as being offended, troubled, and, to speak after the manner of men,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.6.</note>
                     <hi>griev'd at his heart,</hi> at the folly and wickedness of Mankind. All which denotes, although no passion in God, nor ill-will to his Creatures, of both which the Perfection of his Nature renders him uncapable; yet a fixed contrariety and aversion in the divine Nature to all Moral Evil, and on the contrary a full approbation of, and inexpressible love to all Moral Good.</p>
                  <p>And Reason, as well as Scripture, assures us this must be so. For if there be so much unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness, baseness, and deformity in Sin, as I have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52618:43"/>shew'd in my former discourse; if it be so oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the nature both of God and his Creature; and the occasion of so much disorder and confusion in the whole Creation, as I then observ'd; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be otherwise than the object of the divine hatred and displeasure. The better any Creature is, the more he abhors an unhandsome, a dishonest, or a wicked action; and the more he approves and takes pleasure in Virtue and Goodness of all kinds; all which is nothing else but a faint Image of God in his Creature.</p>
                  <p>From the consideration of all this it will appear very reasonable, that if a <hi>Mediator</hi> should interpose between God and Men, he should provide for the honour of this divine Attribute; he should take effectual care that the Holiness or Purity of God should be render'd conspicuous to all the World, even in the manner of receiving his offending Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to Mercy; and that the Method in which God should declare himself reconcileable to Sinners should be such as might consist with, nay fully testifie and express his abhorrence of their sins. Just as when a tender Parent determines to forgive his repenting Child, he will chuse to do it in such a way, as at the same time to discover his real dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure upon account of the Offence he had given, and that in some proportion to the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the offence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Justice</hi> of God, as Governor of the World,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> was also to be regarded in this Case.</p>
                  <p>This Attribute is necessarily joyn'd with that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd. The supreme Lord and Governor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52618:44"/>of the Universe must, from the purity of his Nature, be just and righteous in his Government. And therefore <hi>Abraham,</hi> in his pleading with God for <hi>Sodom,</hi> takes it for granted, that the Judge of the World would do right, and infers from thence, that he would certainly distinguish between the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the Wicked.
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.25.</note>
                     <hi>That be far from thee, to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right!</hi> And as it is the part of a righteous Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, <hi>to make a difference between the righteous and the wicked;</hi> so it is another effect of the same Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, in shewing Mercy to repenting Offenders, to make them thorowly sensible of the heinousness of their Offence. Thus earthly Princes are us'd to do, and 'tis esteem'd an instance of Justice in their proceedings: and why should it not in like manner be a proper instance of Justice in the great Governor of Heaven and Earth; especially where the Offence had so much of obliquity and malignity in it, and so much disorder and mischief consequent upon it, as in the Apostacy of Mankind?</p>
                  <p>The Multitude of Offenders still adds weight to this Consideration. The whole race of Mankind being corrupted, there was so much the greater necessity of their being made sensible of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's displeasure, lest they should have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd to go on in their rebellion, by an easie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity; lest from the <hi>silen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>their hearts</hi> should have been <hi>fully set in them to do evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if we might be allow'd to add, what we Christians take for granted, as being assur'd of it by the Word of God,
<note place="margin">Gen. 2.16, 17.</note> that God had given our first Parents a strict charge, together with a special admonition and warning, as to the instance in which they transgress'd, adding a positive and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere threatning, that <hi>in the day</hi> in which they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress'd, <hi>they should surely dye;</hi> this still makes it more requisite, that the Justice of God should be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly vindicated, before he should offer terms of Reconciliation; and that if he should in Mercy forbear to execute the threatning in its utmost se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, yet he should however make the Sinner thorowly sensible of his desert.</p>
                  <p>I might have added here, that it was very fit, that the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, as well as his <hi>Justice</hi> in governing the World, should be regarded by our <hi>Mediator;</hi> it being evidently an instance of <hi>Wisdom</hi> in a Governor, to render his Authority awful and venerable to his Subjects, and never to appear so soft and easie as to pass by notorious disobedience, without making some severe remarks upon it.</p>
                  <p>I might farther have observ'd, that there was no way so likely to recover the Sinner to repentance, as by thus manifesting the divine Purity, Justice, and Wisdom, in order to the awakening in him a sense of his fault and his danger, and the engaging him to take greater care for the time to come. But this may come into consideration more properly in another place. It may suffice here to have observ'd, that it was very agreeable to the conceptions we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52618:45"/>have both of the divine Nature and our own, that something should be done by our <hi>Mediator,</hi> by way of satisfaction to Almighty God, for the dishonor which had been done to his Attributes by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy of Men.</p>
                  <p>What remains upon this Head is to shew, that the particular Method which our <hi>Media or</hi> hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, did eminently tend to these purposes.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that all the Evils, which have befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len the children of Men, since their Apostacy from God, have been so many expressions and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of God's hatred of Sin, and his love of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as also of the Justice and Wisdom of his Government; but upon serious and impartial consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our blessed Saviour's undertaking, we shall be forc'd to confess, that greater honor hath been given thereby to God, than by all the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which any of the rest of the children of Men have undergone; and that if we do but thorowly lay to heart what he, so great and excellent a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, hath voluntarily done and suffer'd upon our account, it will tend more effectually than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Method we can think of, to the making us sensible of the evil and danger of offending so holy and righteous a Being as God is. For</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Mediator</hi> gave honor to these Attributes of God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by asserting, and publishing, and explaining the Law of God which had been violated by Men; I mean the great Law of Nature, divided into two Tables, requiring the Love of God and Man; which, as they were the two constitutive parts of the natural or moral, so they are also of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Law.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52618:45"/>
                  <p>What our Lord declar'd over and above the meer Law of Nature, namely concerning the Mercy of God in forgiving Sinners upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith in him, was become necessary by reason of transgression; and even in making Repentance and Faith the conditions of acceptance, he hath in an eminent manner done right to God and his Law. For Repentance implys an acknowledgment of our unworthiness in offending God by violating the Law he had given us; and Faith in God through a <hi>Mediator</hi> implys our sense of guilt, and need of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>But besides this, our Lord did openly declare the Righteousness of the divine Law, as first given to Man, by explaining it fully, and inculcating it afresh upon us, and insisting upon the absolute necessity of a sincere Obedience to it, even in this imperfect State, in which we are not capable of yielding that which is absolutely perfect.</p>
                  <p>This appears by the Answer our Saviour gave to the Lawyer,
<note place="margin">Matth. 22.37, 38, 39, 40.</note> telling him that <hi>the Love of God and our Neighbour</hi> were <hi>the two great Commandments of the Law,</hi> and that these were indeed <hi>the Sum of the Law and the Prophets:</hi> but especially by his admirable Discourse upon the Mount,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> wherein he vindicates the Natural or Moral Law of God, from all the false Glosses which the Jewish Doctors had put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, declaring the necessity of regarding even <hi>the least of its Precepts,</hi> by those who hoped to partake of the Kingdom of Heaven; expresly assuring them, that <hi>he came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it,</hi>

                  <p>But of this I may have occasion to discourse more at large, when I come to consider what our <hi>Mediator</hi> hath done towards the relieving our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities; 'tis enough in this place to have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd it, as one instance whereby the righteousness of the divine Law was vindicated, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honor given to the Purity, and Justice, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Mediator</hi> gave honor to these Attributes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in complying strictly and fully with the Law of God in his own Person, and thereby giving a complete instance of Obedience in that Nature which had transgress'd.</p>
                  <p>This was to vindicate the Law of God in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable manner, by shewing the agreeableness and fitness of it to humane Nature, when the Son of God, appearing in this Nature, made it the Rule of his Life, and thereby not only testified his approbation of it; but also shew'd the capacity of humane Nature, whilst innocent and untainted, and attended with the Grace of God to comply perfectly with it.

                  <p>It was not it seems sufficient for our <hi>Mediator</hi> to declare and publish the divine Law afresh; nor to give an instance of perfect Obedience to it in his own person: but it was judg'd requisite also, that he should submit to an afflicted and suffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and at last yield himself to be offer'd up as a Sacrifice upon the Cross, to testifie, in the most significant manner that was possible, the fixed love of God to Righteousness, his unalterable hatred of Sin, his impartial justice in governing the World, the excellency of the Laws which he had given to Men, and the danger of transgressing them.</p>
                  <p>Such was the nature of the Offence given to God by Man's Apostacy, and so bad were the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Mankind, that it seem'd expedient to the great Father and Lord of all, that our <hi>Mediator</hi> should voluntarily humble himself in this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner. The Son of God was admitted to be our <hi>Mediator,</hi> upon no lower Terms than these; as is plainly intimated by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when citing a passage out of a prophetical Psalm, he applies it to our Saviour, and represents him as saying to his Father, when he came into the World,

                     <hi>the Bloud of the new Covenant; viz.</hi> that Bloud in the shedding of which the new Covenant between God and Man, for acceptance upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith, was made and ratified.</p>
                  <p>The Sufferings of our Lord are throughout the Holy Scriptures represented, as making expiation for the Sins of Men; and particularly his death upon the Cross, as it is made to answer all the expiatory Sacrifices under the Law, so it is it self frequently Styled, a Sacrifice and Offering for Sins, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as the means of God's being reconciled to us; and so it evidently was, in as much as by this means the Sins of Men were so openly condemn'd, the Righteousness of God's Law so notoriously declar'd, and by consequence the Holiness and Justice of God so conspicuously honor'd in the view of the World; which certainly may be reasonably call'd, giving Satisfaction to God.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine of our Saviour's offering up himself as a Sacrifice for the Sins of the World, and thereby giving Satisfaction to the great Lord of all, is so fully declar'd throughout the New Testament, and particularly in one whole Epistle, Written, as it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52618:48"/>should seem, to that very purpose, I mean that to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that I knew not how to do right to Christianity, without thus plainly asserting it.</p>
                  <p>I know, that according to the Will of our pious and charitable Founder, I am <hi>not to descend to any Controversies that are amongst Christians themselves,</hi> and therefore I shall not make this <hi>a Controversie,</hi> but take it for granted, as what is not only fully asserted in holy Writ, and agreeable to the sense of the most primitive Christian Antiquity, as well as the judgment of the main Body of Christians throughout every age; but what belongs to the true Christian Scheme, and is necessary to render it entire and of a piece. And though I would be very loth to deny the Title of <hi>Christian,</hi> to any man who seriously lays claim to it, and in so sceptical an Age as this, to lessen the number of Christian Professors: yet I must not, for the sake of such as desert the Christianity which we are taught by the Scriptures, over look so prime a branch of it as this is. Let those, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by this Name, and yet deny that satisfaction was made to God by the Sufferings of Christ for the sins of Men, reconcile their Title and their opinion as well as they can: My business is to assert and vindicate the truth of the Christian Religion, as exhibited to us in the Gospel; and I am so far from thinking the Doctrine of Expiation, and Satisfaction made by the Death of Christ, an objection against the Christian Revelation, that I have judg'd it necessary to insist upon it, as one admirable instance of the Excellency of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52618:49"/>in which our <hi>Mediator</hi> hath obtain'd Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of what I have said upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that our Lord, when he came into the World, took upon him the Character of a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and that he executed his Mediatorial Office, partly by doing that which was greatly for the honor of his Heavenly Father, the Person offended, and consequently well-pleasing and satisfactory to him, making this the first step in procuring Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation between God and Men.</p>
                  <p>The business of my next Discourse will be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to shew how our Lord hath farther executed the same Office, by providing for the Necessities of Men. I shall conclude at present with two short Inferences from what has been now offer'd.</p>
                  <p>If what I have said upon this Subject be true,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> it shews us how little Christianity is beholden to those, who attempt to <hi>lessen</hi> the Person of our <hi>Mediator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This inference will appear just, if we do but observe, that by how much the greater and more considerable the Person of our <hi>Mediator</hi> is, by so much the better qualified he must also be for the obtaining Salvation for us; and particularly by so much the greater will that honor be, which is done to the Attributes of God by his Doctrine, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by his Actions and his Sufferings.</p>
                  <p>It must certainly, in the account of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Man, be a more full and ample declaration
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52618:49"/>of the Holiness and Justice of God, for a Person so near to the Father, as the Scriptures represent our <hi>Mediator</hi> to be, first to condescend so low as to assume our Nature, and then to do and suffer so much upon our account; than for one that was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a meer Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> to have done it. The dignity of the Person transacting this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, must needs add weight to all that was done by him.</p>
                  <p>If this be true,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> what awful thoughts ought we to have of Almighty God! what regard to his Purity, and Justice, and his Authority over us! what fear of dishonoring and offending so Excellent a Majesty! what a dread of wilfully violating any of his known Laws for the future! When he thought fit, notwithstanding the infinite Goodness of his Nature, not to offer us Terms of Mercy, but in the Method of the Gospel; when he would not treat with us at all without a <hi>Mediator;</hi> and when, having appointed his own Son to that Office, he was pleas'd to found and ratifie a New Covenant with us in his Bloud.</p>
                  <p>The reasoning of the Apostle is unanswerable, both with respect to the former part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and the latter. <hi>How shall we escape,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>May Almighty God preserve us all from such Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, in this degenerate Age; may he, if it be possible, recover such as be fallen; and may he give us all Grace, not only to adhere to the Profession of Christianity, but also to bring Reputation to it, by a suitable Practice; through Jesus Christ our only Mediator and Advoeate, to whom, with the Father, and the Eternal Spirit, our great Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, be ascribed all Honor and Glory now and for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>IN treating on these Words, I have endeavor'd to shew the <hi>Credibility</hi> of the <hi>Saying</hi> in the Text, and its <hi>Worthiness to be receiv'd</hi> by us, from the Intrinsick Evidence, which it carries along with it, <hi>viz.</hi> its manifest agreeableness to those Notions, which we naturally have concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and our selves. To make this appear, I proceeded in the following Method.</p>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In what way and manner he hath by his <hi>coming into the World</hi> obtain'd this <hi>Salvation</hi> for them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I have done with the <hi>two</hi> former of these Heads, and have enter'd upon the <hi>third,</hi> in discoursing of which, my design is to make
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52618:53"/>it evident, that the Method in which our Lord hath obtain'd <hi>Salvation</hi> for us is so excellent in it self, so suitable to the Nature of things, so agreeable to all just apprehensions concerning God and our selves, so well adapted to our Necessities and our reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Desires, that the <hi>Saying</hi> in the Text is highly <hi>credible,</hi> and <hi>worthy of all acceptation</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count also.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose I <hi>first</hi> observ'd, that the most comprehensive Notion we can frame of our blessed Saviour's Undertaking is, that which the Holy Scriptures plainly teach us, that he acted as a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> between God and Men; and that it is perfectly agreeable both to the Nature of God, and of fallen Men, that there should be a <hi>Mediator</hi> between them.</p>
                  <p>I then proceeded to consider the Office of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and to shew, that the way in which our Lord doth execute this Office, is altogether agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our most just and reasonable Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>There must be, as I then observ'd, these <hi>two</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Designs, which our Lord must be suppos'd to have carried on, in the execution of his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Office.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>First,</hi> To do whatsoever might satisfie Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, in order to his being reconcil'd to Men.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To do also whatsoever should be found necessary in behalf of Men, in order to the reconciling them to God.</item>
                  </list>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52618:53"/>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these I consider'd the last time, and now proceed to the <hi>second, viz.</hi> to shew how our Lord hath executed the Office of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> in providing for the Necessities of fallen Men, and doing whatsoever might be found requisite, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the reconciling them to their Maker; and I doubt not but that upon serious consideration it will appear, both that there was very great need of the assistance of a <hi>Mediator</hi> upon Man's account; and that no Method we can possibly think of could have so fully answer'd this end of providing for our Necessities, as that which our Lord by his <hi>coming into the World,</hi> hath been pleas'd to take.</p>
                  <p>It might have been imagin'd indeed, that the main difficulty had lay'n, in obtaining the Favor of an offended God to his Apostate Creatures, and that, as immediately upon the first apprehension of the Divine displeasure, sinful Men should have been ready to implore the Mercy of their Creator; so upon the first intimation of Mercy, they should have been forward to receive it: but upon Examination we shall find, that there was really much greater difficulty in recovering Men to God, than in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling God to Men.</p>
                  <p>For such is the Divine Goodness, that nothing was necessary on God's part, but only to make it fit for him to forgive his Creatures, and to receive them to Mercy. The tender compassion of our Heavenly Father was mov'd towards his disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Children, as soon as ever he beheld them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable through their own Folly; and because his Holiness and Justice and Wisdom made it highly requisite (as I have observ'd in my last discourse)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52618:54"/>that an Expiation should be made for the dishonour done to these Attributes by the Sins of Men, his Goodness therefore mov'd him to find out and to appoint an Expiation, which should be entirely Satisfactory to him, and to send his only begotten Son into the World to this purpose. For which reason the Scripture so often magnifies the Love of God,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 4.9, 10.</note> in giving his Son for us. <hi>In this,</hi> saith St. <hi>John, was manifested the love of God towards us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that God sent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> After which there could be no place left for a suspicion of his readiness to accept the Satisfaction, which was offer'd to him by this Mediator of his own appointing.</p>
                  <p>But with Men the case was far otherwise. There was much indisposition and inability in them, likely to obstruct their returning to God, and being reconcil'd to him. It was no light Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to remove the Suspicion and Jealousie, which Siuners had entertain'd, with respect to the divine Goodness, which they were Conscious they had so unworthily disoblig'd; and to take off that aversion of Mind from God, which naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd upon such a Jealousie. A new discovery of Divine Truth, and a fresh supply of Spiritual Strength became necessary, upon account of the ignorance and weakness which Men had contracted; and particularly the interposure of Supernatural Grace to Conquer the perverseness and obstinacy of their Wills. And after all much Power and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52618:54"/>Wisdom were requisite for removing all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining inconveniencies and mischiefs, which the Sins of Men had expos'd them to, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting that Salvation which they stood in need of. That therefore which we have to do, is to take a particular and distinct view of the various Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of fallen Men, which were to be provided for by a <hi>Mediator,</hi> in order to the reconciling them to God, and conferring <hi>Salvation</hi> upon them; and to shew that <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> by his <hi>coming into the World,</hi> hath so abundantly provided for all these Necessities, and that in a manner so far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing any other Method, which our thoughts are able to suggest to us, as thereby farther to recommend his Institution to our <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> as worthy of God, and fit for us. And this we may do under the following Heads.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Men by their Apostacy had fallen into a Suspicion and Jealousie, with respect to the divine Goodness, and an alienation of Mind from God, as the Consequence thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> They were degenerated into an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, and of themselves, and of the several particulars of their Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They had contracted an indisposition and inability to comply with the divine Will, when fully and clearly manifested to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> After all they were under an incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of removing many other evil and mischievous consequences, which their Sins had expos'd them to, and obtaining for themselves that complete Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they stood in need of.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52618:55"/>
                  <p>Of each of these I shall by God's Assistance dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course severally, and shew, as I go along, how our Lord in executing his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Office hath provided for all these Necessities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> To begin with that Suspicion and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, with respect to the divine Goodness, which Sinners were fallen into, and that Alienation of Mind from God, which was consequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                  <p>This I formerly took notice of, when I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd the Case of our first Parents, as represented by <hi>Moses,</hi> how they discover'd their dread of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and the Estrangement of their Minds from him, immediately after their fall, by declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Presence, and hiding themselves from him, as soon as they had any intimations of his approach. I observ'd likewise, that this is in some measure the case of all Sinners, that have not hardned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by a long Custom in doing evil. And if we take a view of Mankind, antecedently to any known declaration of God's Mercy to them by some express Revelation, we shall find that 'tis true in experience, that there arises an awe and dread from the Consciousness of Guilt, together with a dissatisfaction as to the Ways and Means of appeasing the divine displeasure, the consequence of which must be, according to the frame and constitution of Humane Nature, a want of that filial Reverence and Love, which is due to the great Father of all.</p>
                  <p>And this I take to have been the apparent ground of those many superstitious Practices in the Pagan World, whereby they attempted to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52618:55"/>atone their supposed Deities, even by very unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Methods, sacrificing to that purpose, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all sorts of Animals, but even those of their own kind, offering up humane blood, the blood even of their Sons and Daughters, for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Sins. For, although I doubt not, but sacrificing had its Original from a divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and that Tradition had spread the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice throughout the World; yet this Tradition being by degrees corrupted, Men fell into the use of such Sacrifices, not as God had at first appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as to their own vain and foolish Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which varied in different Regions, seem'd most likely to appease the wrath of their incensed Deities. It was from their mistaken and corrupted apprehensions of the divine Nature, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Expiations, which it was neither fit for the divine Majesty to accept, nor for reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to offer: but it was their consciousness of guilt, conspiring with an antient Tradition, which did naturally and reasonably move them to think some Expiation or other requisite; and forasmuch as they did not well know, what might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, there still remain'd a dissatisfaction and uneasiness, after all their attempts that way.</p>
                  <p>But not to look so far abroad. I dare appeal, for the truth of this, to the inward sense of our own Minds. Let but any man faithfully consult his own Conscience, and recollect the thoughts which have arisen within his Breast, whenever he has been Conscious of having done an ill thing, I doubt not, but if he will ingenuously own what he finds there, it will be to this purpose; that his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52618:56"/>guilt has made him not only asham'd, but afraid too, it has possest him with a just apprehension of the displeasure of the Almighty, it has more or less estranged his Mind from that excellent Being, render'd him shy of addressing himself to him, and doubtful of his acceptance; if he was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly habituated to acts of Devotion, he became upon this more averse to them; if he had been accustomed to address himself seriously to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, his Devotion henceforward became cool and flat, his Faith and Hope in God were appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently abated, and he was in danger of contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an habitual estrangement from him, unless from the encouragement which the Gospel gives to Repentance, he quickly bethought himself, and recover'd his temper again. Insomuch that I doubt not, but it is much more difficult for a man deeply sensible of any guilt that he has contracted, either to forgive himself, or to believe firmly that God hath forgiven him, than it is for God to do it. It requires both a great sense of the divine Goodness founded upon the doctrine of the Gospel, and a temper like to that of God therein represented, for a Man that knows and feels what it is wilfully to have transgress'd the Laws of his Maker, firmly to believe and hope in him.</p>
                  <p>And all this seems to arise from the make and constitution of our Souls. It hath pleas'd our Creator wisely and graciously to order the matter so in our very formation, that this uneasiness and dissatisfaction, this fear and dread should be the consequence of our doing amiss, from a kind of natural Instinct, as a restraint and check upon us,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52618:56"/>that we might not only apprehend the malignity of Sin from reasoning and inferring, but might also be sensible of it by inward feeling; insomuch that he who wants such a sense, after any sin knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wilfully committed by him, is one who either never yet had his Mind awaken'd to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of divine things, or who has stupified his Conscience by a long Custom in Evil-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, as I before observ'd, we have implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us natural apprehensions also of the divine Goodness and Mercy: but forasmuch as the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the Justice of God (concerning which I had occasion to discourse in my last Lecture) are as evident to our thoughts as his Goodness is, there is a foundation of Fear, as well as of Hope, laid in our Minds, and such a Fear, as will be apt to keep the Sinner at a very uneasie distance from his Maker, till he shall be pleas'd some way or other to reveal his Mercy to him.</p>
                  <p>God hath indeed given many intimations of his kind Intentions towards the Children of Men, all along since their first Apostacy, by sparing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, and providing for them, by bestowing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Blessing upon them,
<note place="margin">Acts 14.17.</note> by <hi>doing them good, and giving them rain from Heaven, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful seasons, filling their hearts with food and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> thereby <hi>not leaving himself without witness,</hi> as the Apostle speaks. Nay he hath, as we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans believe, laid a sure foundation for the hope of Mankind,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> by his gracious Promise made to our First Parents, of the <hi>Seed of the VVoman,</hi> which to the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was still farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52618:57"/>and confirm'd by following Predictions, and might by the help of an obscure Tradition be the occasion also of reviving Mens Hopes in God, even in other Nations, all which was but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Edition of the Gospel Revelation. But by <hi>this</hi> only we have the ground of our Fear wholly remov'd, and our Hopes render'd clear and lively.</p>
                  <p>For nothing certainly can be conceiv'd of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual force for restoring the Faith and Hope of Mankind in their offended Creator, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his having sent his only begotten Son into the World to become our <hi>Mediator.</hi> This is a Declaration of <hi>the Goodness and Philanthropy of God,</hi>

                  <p>This was one main Design of our Saviour's Preaching, to declare the good Will of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father toward the Children of Men, and his readiness to receive them, upon their return to him. They are his own words,

                  </p>
                  <p>Mankind in general were apprehensive of the need of a Sacrifice to be made for Sins, being led into this apprehension (as I have already observ'd) partly by an antient Tradition, and partly by a sense of guilt, and as the consequence thereof great doubts and fears concerning the divine acceptance; and the <hi>Jews</hi> had been admonish'd of the need and use of Sacrifices, by the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> our <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> therefore once for all offer'd up such a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as might for ever put an end to the use of that Rite, and yield full satisfaction to the minds
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52618:58"/>of Men, that complete Expiation was now made to God for their Offences.

                     <hi>having our hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here by the way, we may take notice of the Wisdom of God, in disposing the Method of our Reconciliation in such manner, that by one and the same Act, <hi>viz.</hi> that of dying upon the Cross as a Sacrifice for Sin, our <hi>Mediator</hi> gave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Satisfaction both to God and Man; to God, upon account of the dishonour done to his Holiness and Justice, as I shew'd in my former Discourse; and to Men, upon account of the fear and dread with which their Minds were possess'd by reason of Guilt.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52618:59"/>
                  <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>first</hi> of those Necessities, for which our <hi>Mediator</hi> provided, by his <hi>coming into the VVorld.</hi> I proceed to the next.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Men by their Apostacy were likewise degenerated into gross Ignorance of God, and of themselves, and of the several particulars of their Duty.</p>
                  <p>What knowledge of God, and of matters relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Spiritual Welfare, Men are capable of in this lapsed State, if they would seriously attend to the Suggestions and Reasonings of their own Minds, and diligently use the Faculties which God hath given them, need not be disputed. If we would know what need the World stood in of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from God, 'twill be proper to examine, into what degree of Ignorance it was degenerated, when our Lord came into it, and how the Case stands at this time, wheresoever the Gospel is not yet divulg'd.</p>
                  <p>They were not only false, but monstrous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which the Pagans had generally entertain'd concerning the Deity. They had either totally lost, or notoriously confounded the Notion of the one true God, Maker of Heaven and Earth, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a multitude of Gods, concerning whom they had no settled apprehensions, but abundance of foolish and absurd Opinions, according to the variety of their loose and wanton Fancies. <hi>They chang'd the truth of God into a Lye,</hi>

                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52618:59"/>They were for the most part insensible of the Spiritual Nature of God, which they plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by the multitude of their ridiculous Images, as well as by the whole Order of their Worship. They had gross misapprehensions with respect to the Moral Perfections of the divine Nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing those Qualities to their Gods, which would be a dishonour to any reasonable Creature, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not merely by the Writings of their Poets, but more undeniably by their impious and unclean Rites of Worship.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the Vulgar only misled into these gross Errors;
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.22.</note> but men of all Ranks and Orders amongst them, even those <hi>who profess'd themselves to be wise became fools</hi> in this respect; and although some of their Philosophers attain'd to wiser and better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions themselves, yet they generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with the Vulgar Modes of Worship, which, howsoever they might endeavour to accommodate to their own apprehensions, by certain interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they put upon them, were extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Majesty of the true God.</p>
                  <p>And if they thus mistook and prevaricated with respect to God, and the Worship which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd immediately to the Deities they own'd, no wonder if at the same time they had very false No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions also with respect to other parts of their Duty; especially considering that they were not only ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of God, but of themselves too.</p>
                  <p>They knew not their Original; they had lost the Tradition of being descended from one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stock, as likewise of the institution of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by God himself in the instance of our first
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52618:60"/>Parents. They were unacquainted with the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Man's body being form'd out of the Dust of the Earth, and inspir'd with the breath of God, and consequently did not so clearly discern the difference between the two parts of which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were constituted. They were very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at the best, as to the Spiritual and Immortal Nature of their Souls, and altogether at a loss as to the condition of a future State, if there should prove to be any. They were sensible by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of impetuous and disorderly Appetites and Passions; but could give no tolerable account how this disorder was introduc'd into humane Nature, nor did they generally apprehend the necessity they lay under of returning to the temper and state from which they were degenerated, or of that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Aid, which was become necessary to this purpose. In fine, they knew not well for what purpose they were made, nor to what end they ought to direct their Lives.</p>
                  <p>All this Ignorance of themselves they too plainly discover'd, in allowing divers practices contrary to the design and Law of God in Nature; such as I shall at present take for granted were Polygamy, Divorce upon slight Occasions, private Revenge of Injuries, not to mention the gratification of unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Lusts. In a word, they not having a just sense of the difference between Soul and Body, and of the Relation this present state of Life bears to a future, did not think themselves oblig'd to lay that restraint upon either their Appetites or Passions, which is fit for a reasonable Creature, design'd to five in this World in order to a better.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52618:60"/>
                  <p>If we will judge by the Practices into which the generality of Pagans were degenerated, this will appear beyond Controversie. So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> might well give that Character of them, that they were <hi>dead in trespasses and Sins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1.1,</note> that they <hi>fulfill'd the desires of the flesh and of the mind,</hi> finally,
<note place="margin">3,</note>that they <hi>had no hope,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">12.</note>and were <hi>without God in the world.</hi> And though there were some few to be found here and there, who had attain'd to better appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of things, and laid down stricter Rules of Life and Manners, than others; yet as their apprehensions were very imperfect, and for the most part wavering and uncertain, so they did not express themselves in that plain, perspicuous, and authoritative manner, which was likely to render what they said useful to the generality of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>And as this was the state of the World before the Revelation of Christianity; so it is much the same, wheresoever this Revelation is not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, as appears from all the accounts we have of those Countreys which are still Pagan.</p>
                  <p>I think I need not here take into Consideration, how far the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion has improv'd Men in divine Knowledge, where it has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd in the room of Paganism. For though 'tis readily acknowledg'd that it has made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in that one great Point, the confessing one God, the Maker of Heaven and Earth; yet considering the ridiculous Fables with which its <hi>Alchoran</hi> abounds, whereby God himself is very unworthily represented; the looseness of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts with respect to divers instances of Morality; not to mention the apparent Ignorance and Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52618:61"/>of its pretended Prophet, I am sure no serious Deist will make any comparison between <hi>that</hi> and the Christian Revelation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed had a fuller Revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, and themselves, and the particulars of their Duty, that the rest of the World had; but as these were a very inconsiderable People, compar'd with the rest of Mankind, so their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation and Rule of Life was in many respects imperfect, God in Givers instances considering the weakness and rudeness of that People, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not giving them such Precepts as were best in themselves, but such as they could bear, design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Revelation which he made to them, only as preparatory to that more excellent and perfect Revelation which he should make of himself and his Will, by the coming of his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>To the consideration therefore of <hi>this</hi> we are now to proceed, and I doubt not but it will easily appear, that our <hi>Mediator</hi> hath made a gracious and plentiful provision for this Necessity of fallen Men; and that whether we consider his <hi>Doctrine</hi> or his <hi>Life,</hi> the former as an <hi>Instruction,</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as an <hi>Example</hi> to us, to make us perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with God and his Will concerning us.</p>

                     </note> saith he, <hi>and for this cause came I into the World, that I should bear witness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Truth. Every one that is of the Truth, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ith my Voice.</hi> And his whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> is evidently
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52618:61"/>worthy of that Title, its Truth being discernable by its own Light.</p>
                  <p>All that our Lord taught may be reduced to these <hi>two</hi> general Heads; either what God had before taught Men by the Light of Nature and Reason, but they had in a great measure forgot; or something which it became farther necessary for them to know, upon account of their Apostacy from God, and in order to their recovery to him, and which they could not have known but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Revelation.</p>
                  <p>As to the former of these, I dare upon the nicest Examination appeal to the Judgment and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of those Deists, to whom I direct these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, whether the Doctrine of our Lord, and that of right Reason do not perfectly agree. I will not say, that in this degenerate State, in which we now are, men did or could easily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a just apprehension of all those Truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Religion, which are truly natural, and agreeable to Reason, when once discover'd. We find by Experience, as I have already observ'd, that where Revelation was or is wanting, men have generally fallen into very gross and vile mistakes; and even the wisest and best of Men have come very far short in their Account. But 'tis enough to our present purpose, if when any Truth is laid clearly before us by Revelation, it then appears evidently agreeable to natural Reason; and this I affirm to be the Case with respect to most of the Doctrines of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>And it ought not by any means to be allow'd as an Objection against Christianity, that our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52618:62"/>Lord hath superadded some Doctrines, which were not taught by the Light of Nature and Reason, provided always they be such, as do not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict plain and evident Reason, and as when we throughly consider them, will appear highly useful to us, with respect to the state in which we now are. If Almighty God do exercise a Providence towards his Creatures, if he have that tender Care of and Compassion towards Men and Sinners, of which I have already discours'd, if he was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleas'd to concern himself for us after our fall, and to reveal himself to us in order to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, it cannot be thought otherwise, but that he should teach us some Truths relating to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Circumstances, which we could not have known, but by immediate Revelation from him. 'Tis very becoming the Wisdom of God, when he revealeth himself to his Creatures in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, to instruct them in what they knew not before, nay to teach them something, that according to their ordinary ways of thinking would not have enter'd into their Minds; and it must needs be a delightful entertainment to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, as well as a worthy Improvement of our Minds to contemplate and embrace such Truths. It is therefore a recommendation of the Christian Revelation, at the first hearing, that it pretends to discover such Truths to us.</p>
                  <p>But that I may treat this matter distinctly, I shall reduce what I have to offer as to our Saviour's Doctrine to these three particulars.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">I. To begin with the Doctrine of Christianity concerning Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>Now the Sum of the Christian Doctrine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Point is to the purpose following, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is but one God; that he is a Spirit, Eternal, Incomprehensible, and Unchangeable, Infinite in Power, Wisdom, Holiness, Justice, Goodness, and in all Perfection; that he gave Being to the World, and to every Creature in it; that his Providence is extended to all which he hath made, preserving and providing for every Being according to its nature; that he particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns himself in the Affairs of Mankind; that there is nothing which relates to us, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther escapes his Knowledge, or is below his Care; that he observes all our ways, and that as he hath given us intimations of his Will, so he expects we should be observant of them; that he is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd with us, when we do well, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd when we do otherwise; that he is full of Good-will towards us and truly desirous of our Welfare, of which he hath given us many Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, in order to excite and establish our Faith and Hope in him, as well as to engage our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Submission to him.</p>
                  <p>And thus far I presume our Deist will go along with us; I am sure 'tis fit he should, there being nothing of what I have hitherto mention'd, but what is perfectly agreeable to the best reasonings of Men, and what has been acknowledg'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by those who have exercised their Reason in the best manner.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52618:63"/>
                  <p>'Tis true, some have made it a doubt, whether it were fit to suppose Almighty God to extend his Providence to so many and so minute Particulars, as the Christian Revelation plainly represents him to do; when we are assur'd for Instance, that <hi>a Sparrow falls not on the ground without our Father;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>
                     </note> and that <hi>the very hairs of our head are all number'd.</hi> But if we reflect upon the infinite Knowledge and Goodness of God; and consider that it cannot be below him to concern himself for the good of whatsoever he hath made; that the very same reason which mov'd him to give Being to any Creature, and to give it such a kind of Being as it hath, may well be suppos'd to move him also to take care of its well-being; and that it can be no manner of trouble or disquiet to him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard all the Affairs of the Universe at once; if I say we reflect upon all these things, we shall easily get above this doubt, and acknowledge, that what our Lord hath declar'd concerning the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars before mentioned, is perfectly agreeable to the dictates of sound reason, worthy of God, as well as comfortable to men.</p>
                  <p>As to what Christianity hath farther reveal'd to us concerning God, 'tis to the following Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> that the Father of all hath actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd himself for the recovery of sinful Men, and that he hath done it by sending his only-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son into the World to redeem us, and by giving his Holy Spirit to Sanctifie us, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more than we could have known concerning God without an express Revelation.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52618:63"/>
                  <p>Now as to the more general part of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, namely, that God hath actually concern'd himself for our Recovery, this is highly <hi>credible and worthy of our acceptation</hi> upon the grounds I have hitherto proceeded. For if, as I have already prov'd, it be a reasonable apprehension concerning God, that he would in some way or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the recovery of such of his reasonable Creatures as were capable of it, it must certainly be reasonable to hearken attentively to a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which assures us that he hath done so. This is to be dispos'd to believe, what we before hoped might be; and to embrace a Doctrine, which we thought would be credible, whensoever it should be reveal'd to us.</p>
                  <p>As to the particular way in which God hath done this, namely, by the Father's sending his Son to redeem us, and giving his Holy Spirit to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie us, this as it is a matter of pure Revelation, so it must be own'd, that it will lead us into some apprehensions concerning the Deity, which we could not have form'd of our selves. For in our reasoning concerning the divine Nature, our thoughts would have stopt at <hi>the Father</hi> of all, and reach'd no farther. Upon which account I cannot but reckon that the Notion of the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, which bears so great a resemblance to that of the Christian Trinity, was by no means the result of their meer reasoning; but the remains of an Ancient Tradition. Which by the way is no small confirmation of the Truth of this Christian Doctrine, when something so very like it, and which there appears no plausible pretence for ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52618:64"/>to humane invention, was yet embrac'd by the very best among the Pagan Philosophers, and that so heartily, as to be made an essential part of their Philosophical Scheme.</p>
                  <p>I remember whose Lectures I am reading, and therefore will not transgress the Laws of our <hi>Founder,</hi> by entering upon this Controversie as managed amongst Christians. 'Tis sufficient to my present purpose, that, as I have already exprest it, it is universally own'd as a Christian Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Father hath Redeem'd Mankind by his Son, and Sanctifieth them by his Spirit; and if this Doctrine, which is unquestionably Christian, and our being Baptized according to it, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, when we enter upon our Profession, do necessarily lead us, as I said, into some apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions concerning the Deity, which we could not have taken up without Revelation, I ask, why this should be any Objection against Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>After all the Controversies which have been started amongst Christians, upon this sublime Theory, 'tis agreed and stood to by all, that there is but one God, and that however the Christian Trinity is to be explain'd (if it be fit to attempt the explaining it at all) it must ever be suppos'd consistent with this Fundamental Article of all true Religion. Our Lord himself repeating, and confirming the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> saith, <hi>Hear O Israel! The Lord thy God is one Lord;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 12.29.</note> and all Christians positively assert the same; even those, who either
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52618:64"/>through mistake or ill-will are accus'd of asserting a plurality of Gods, utterly deny and abhor the Charge, declaring, that if any such consequences could be fairly drawn from the Premisses they have laid down, they would freely retract what they have said.</p>
                  <p>Now this Principle, of the Unity of the divine Nature, being thus secur'd amongst Christians, what if after this we should not be able to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the Doctrine of the Trinity, or to tell in what manner the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are distinguish'd, and yet but One God? I would ask; why should any one take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that God may not intimate to us something relating to his own Nature, which we could not have thought of our selves, any more than we can fully comprehend it, when it is thus intimated to us? <hi>Canst thou,</hi> O vain Man! (to speak in the words of an antient and honest Deist, recorded in the book of <hi>Job) Canst thou by searching find out God?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 11.7, 8, 9.</note>
                     <hi>Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? It is as high as Heaven, what canst thou do? Deeper than Hell, what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea.</hi> Which words, though they may immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately relate to the divine Providence, may be as fitly apply'd to the divine Nature. How should we come to know, that it is impossible there should have been Eternally, of and with the Father of all, a Son, and a Spirit, not Created, but necessarily partaking of the divine Nature, and Essential to it? I dare boldly affirm, that no Man can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the Impossibility of this; and if he cannot,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52618:65"/>he ought not to make it an Objection against the Christian Revelation, that in making known to us the Method of our Salvation it hath instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted us in this Doctrine. 'Tis certainly as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, to reveal to us concerning himself more than we could have thought of without such a Revelation, as it is for him to do such great and kind things for us, as could not have enter'd into our hearts, if he had not assur'd us of them; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since, though we are not able fully to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all that this Doctrine implies, yet what we are taught concerning it by the Holy Scriptures is of great use to us, to make us understand and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Method, in which it hath pleas'd God to save Sinners; and it appears indeed to have been reveal'd to us for this very end.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have summ'd up the Doctrine which the Christian Revelation hath taught us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Almighty God, which whosoever will take the pains impartially to consider, as it is more fully and particularly represented to us in the New Testament, will find reason to acknowledge, that our <hi>Mediator</hi> hath made ample Provision for the relief of our Necessity in this Instance also.</p>
                  <p>To which I shall only add, that what the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings contain upon this Subject, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd there in such manner, as to instruct the Illiterate, as well as the Learned part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; insomuch that wheresoever the Christian Religion is entertain'd, great Numbers even of the Common People have more true, more solid,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52618:65"/>and more useful apprehensions of Almighty God, than the Learned and Wise Men amongst the Pagans did ordinarily attain to; and surely this is a great Commendation of our Holy Religion, and a farther proof, that <hi>This is a faithful Saying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I should now have proceeded to consider, what our Lord hath taught us concerning our selves; and especially the Excellent Rules which he hath given us, for the direction of our Tempers and our Lives; but this I must reserve for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lecture.</p>

                  <p>I Have been considering the intrinsick Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this <hi>saying,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, from the apparent excellency of the Method in which our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ hath obtain'd Salvation for us; to which purpose I have been treating of his <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Office, in the two great branches of it, <hi>viz.</hi> As he hath done whatsoever might satisfie Almighty God, in order to his being reconcil'd to Men; and also whatsoever was found necessary in the behalf of Men, in order to the reconciling them to God.</p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> A suspicion and jealousie of Mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, and an alienation from him, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent thereupon.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> After all, an incapacity of removing those other evil and mischievous Consequences, to which their Sins had expos'd them, and obtaining for themselves that compleat Salvation, which they stood in need of.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>first</hi> of these I discours'd the last time, and enter'd upon the <hi>second.</hi> I then consider'd how gross and universal the Ignorance of Men was, before the coming of our Lord, and began to shew how our <hi>Mediator</hi> hath provided for this necessity of Mankind, both by his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and his <hi>Life;</hi> by the former, as an <hi>Instruction;</hi> by the latter, as an <hi>Example</hi> to us, to make us throughly acquainted with all, that it is fit for us to know, as to the several particulars before-mention'd.</p>

                  <p>In each of these Instances I propos'd to make it evident, by God's assistance, that our Saviour's Doctrine is most worthy to be taught by God, and to be receiv'd by us, and consequently that upon this account, <hi>It is a faithful saying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I have done with the <hi>first</hi> of these, <hi>viz.</hi> our Saviour's Doctrine concerning Almighty God, and now proceed to the</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Viz.</hi> What our Saviour hath taught us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our selves, which I shall dispatch in a few words, that I may come to that which is of main Consideration with respect to the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, namely its Rules for our Tempers and our Lives.</p>
                  <p>Now with respect to our selves, as well as with respect to Almighty God, the Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath either illustrated and confirm'd to us what the Light of Nature and Reason, if duly us'd, might have discover'd concerning Humane Nature; or else hath added something beyond what we could have known that way.</p>
                  <p>Thus for Instance, That we were produc'd into Being by God the Creator of all, and made such a kind of Creatures as we find our selves to be, <hi>viz.</hi> compos'd of Immaterial and Immortal Spirits, as well as Bodies of Flesh; that consequently we are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52618:70"/>capable of, and design'd for a Future State, our Spirits not being obnoxious to Death from any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which we can discern in them, although as Experience tells us, our Fleshly Tabernacles are liable to dissolution; that we are intelligent and reasonable Creatures, and for that Reason accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our Maker for our Behaviour. Moreover, that by some means or other we are disorder'd in our whole frame, forasmuch as we find, not only that we are exposed to Diseases of Body, and at last to Death it self; but also that our Appetites and Passions are apt to rebel against our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Reason, which must needs be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and degeneracy in our Nature, it not being at all credible, that so good a Being as God is, should have originally form'd us in so disorderly a state. Such Apprehensions as these the best of Men amongst the Pagans were apt to entertain, from the meer Light of Reason; they inclin'd to think that this in general was the state of Humane Nature; though, as it is very apparent by their Writings, their Apprehensions of these things were very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and uncertain.</p>
                  <p>But all this the Doctrine of our Saviour hath fully assur'd us of, in plain and express terms, and such as leave no room for doubt; adding thereunto, (if we take in what Christianity always supposes and takes for granted, <hi>viz.</hi> the Revelation of God by <hi>Moses,</hi>) a much more particular and exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Humane Nature, than we could possibly have receiv'd from meer Reason. The account in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed which we have of our selves, by the Jewish and Christian Revelation join'd together, is such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52618:70"/>as lets us into the perfect Knowledge of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and the Design of our Beings; what we were, as we came out of God's hands; how we have abus'd our selves; and consequently what is necessary to be done either by or for us, in order to our Recovery.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there any thing therein, but what, if duly consider'd, will appear, after it is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, perfectly reasonable to be believ'd, so far from contradicting, that it exceedingly confirms and improves our natural Apprehensions concerning our selves.</p>
                  <p>Thus for Instance, That God having form'd this Earth, and furnish'd it with a great variety of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, fitted for the use or delight of such Beings as we are, produc'd the first Man, appointing him and his Posterity to be the Inhabitants of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and assigning to them the use and government of all the Creatures below them; that he form'd the Body of Man out of the Dust of the Earth, and breath'd into his Nostrils the Breath of Life, thus making him related, by the two constitutive parts of his Nature, both to the upper and the lower World; that he form'd a Companion for him, like to him, making but one of each Sex, and joining them together by the strictest alliance, that they might be mutual Helps and Comforts to each other, and might become the common Parents of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who, by thus descending from the same Stock, might be taught to look upon themselves as near of kin; that this first Man and Woman were plac'd in easie and happy Circumstances, endued with the Image of God, both in the Intellectual and Moral
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52618:71"/>Powers of their Souls, and enjoying his Favour, bless'd with Innocence of Mind, and Health of Body, naturally dispos'd and greatly oblig'd to obey the Commands of their great and good Creator; but that being tempted and deluded by a malicious Enemy both to God and them, and giving way to their Appetites and Passions, without duly consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reason of their Minds, or invoking the assistance of Heaven, they disobey'd their Maker, and render'd themselves obnoxious to his just Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure; that these first Sinners were upon this dismiss'd from that happy place and state, in which they had been created, and turn'd out into a World of Misery and Sorrow; that having weaken'd and deprav'd their own Nature by misusing it, they convey'd the Weakness and Corruption to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, the Blood which their Off-spring deriv'd from them being tainted in its original; that partly as the natural Consequence of what they had done, and partly by the just Appointment of their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Maker, Sickness, and Pain, and Death, were the effects of their Disobedience, and this their first Sin was the Beginning of all those Evils, to which they and their Posterity have been since expos'd, and the Occasion of all that Disorder which is to be found in this lower World; and consequently, that if ever we hope to be happy, it must be by having the Image of God repair'd in us, by being restor'd to his Favour, by having our Souls recover'd to their due Temper by the communication of Divine Grace, by having our Bodies also, after their disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, re-united to our Spirits by the Almighty Power, that so we may be perfect and entire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52618:71"/>to our primitive Constitution; and finally, by having perfect Health and Vigour restor'd to the whole Man.</p>
                  <p>This is plainly the substance of what the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine teacheth us concerning our selves, whereby, as it greatly illustrates and confirms what was before but imperfectly and confusedly guess'd at by Men of the best Understandings and Morals; so it adds several particulars of great moment, which, although they are either what we had lost the tradition of, or what we could not certainly have known without Revelation, yet being reveal'd, can I think by no means shock the Reason of any serious Deist. On the contrary, as this Scheme is infinitely more rational, than any thing that has been produc'd upon this Subject by the Authors of any other Religion; so it is exceedingly agreeable to all the present Phaenomena of Humane Nature, yielding the most satisfactory account of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the present Condition, the Design and End of Mankind, and laying a good foundation for those Rules which the Christian Doctrine hath given us for the government of our selves; and this brings me to the next particular I propos'd to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Those Rules which the Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath laid down for the management of our Tempers and our Lives; which, as I am now to shew, do yet farther recommend to us the Method in which our <hi>Mediator</hi> hath obtain'd <hi>Salvation</hi> for <hi>Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had the Christian Institution fail'd in this point,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52618:72"/>there had lain an unanswerable Objection against it, especially since it pretends to bring us the last and fullest Revelation of the Divine Will, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or perfect whatsoever went under the name of Religion before: but this we Christians justly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in, that it hath fully made good this Pretence, and that even its Adversaries cannot plausibly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject any thing against it upon this account, unless it be that its Rules seem to them too strict, too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for the present state of Humane Nature; which, whether it be a reasonable Objection, will fall under Consideration hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In confirmation of this Point, I might insist upon those passages of our Saviour, which I had occasion just to recite in a former Discourse; as where our Lord replies to the Lawyer,
<note place="margin">Mat. 22 36, &amp;c.</note> asking him, <hi>Which was the great Commandment in the Law? Jesus said unto him,</hi> as it follows in the Text, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind; This is the first and great Commandment: and the second is like unto it; Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self. On these two Commandments hang all the Law, and the Prophets.</hi> Where our Lord not only explains the Law both of <hi>Moses</hi> and of Nature in their full extent; but also plainly enough insinuates, that these two great Rules should be the fundamental Laws of his own Institution; for in the place parallel to this in St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Gospel,
<note place="margin">Mark 12.34.</note> upon the <hi>Scribes</hi> approving this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of our Lord, and repeating it in other words, 'tis said, that <hi>when Jesus saw that he answer'd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God.</hi> For which Reason in that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52618:72"/>Discourse upon the Mount, where in express terms, and most solemn manner, he deliver'd his Precepts to his Disciples, he plainly tells them,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.17, &amp;c.</note> that <hi>he came not to destroy the Law or the Prophets, but to fulfil them,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, one way of doing which was, as I before observ'd, and as appears undeniably from the Discourse immediately following those words, by interpreting them in their fullest extent; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in the prosecution of that Argument, he commandeth his Disciples to aim at the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Virtue and Goodness,
<note place="margin">Ver. 48.</note> even <hi>to be perfect as their Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might add to this, the Declaration which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes of the general design of the Gospel-Institution, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>it teacheth all men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11, 12.</note>
                     <hi>that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ungodliness and worldly lusts, they should live so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteously, and godly in this present World;</hi> this being, as he says, the very end of our Saviour's <hi>giving himself for us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">14.</note>
                     <hi>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might in the last place alledge that comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Exhortation of the same Apostle,
<note place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note>
                     <hi>Finally Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These general Rules and Precepts are so very full, as evidently to include the whole of Morality; insomuch that a Christian may fairly challenge a Philosopher, or a Jew, or any other person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, who seriously believes a God, and embraces
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52618:73"/>the Principles of Natural Religion, to name that Virtue which is not comprehended under them. And whosoever will carefully peruse the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shall find not only many more such general and comprehensive Rules therein contain'd; but also abundance of particular Directions and Precepts agreeable thereunto. So that although there be not, throughout the Writings of the Evangelists and Apostles, a system of Morality drawn up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Model of the Schools; (which had not been suitable to the nature and design of those Writings, nor adapted to the use of those for whom they were intended;) yet a Man that way dispos'd might easily form from thence the most perfect and admirable Scheme of Moral Discipline, that ever yet was produc'd.</p>
                  <p>But for the rendering this more evident, it may be proper to descend to particulars, and to view the Precepts of Christianity, according to the usual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, as they concern our demeanour towards God, our Neighbour, or our selves, in doing which, I shall not stand to cite particular Texts, but only give the sum of the Christian Doctrine, upon each of these Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As they concern our demeanour towards Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
                  <p>Here the Precepts of true Religion should begin, the Authority of God being the great Basis of all particular Laws of Religion, and our Reverence and Love towards him being the genuine Principles of every other Grace or Virtue. And accordingly here our Christian Institution lays the Foundation,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52618:73"/>endeavouring to raise up our Thoughts to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being, and to possess our Minds with the deepest sense of him. This therefore is the sum of the Precepts left us by our Lord, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, with respect to God; That we should fear and reverence him as the greatest and best of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; that we should excite and cherish in our Souls a pious Affection towards him as our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that we should depend constantly upon him for whatsoever we stand in need of; that we should be deeply sensible of his Goodness to us, in all the Blessings we enjoy, and put our trust in him, for whatsoever he shall see truly good for us; that we should willingly resign our selves to him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquiesce in all the dispensations of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards us; that we should esteem his Image as our highest Perfection, and his Favour as our chief Happiness, and therefore above all things endeavour to resemble him, and to be accepted of him; that we should make his Glory our ultimate end, and subordinate all our other designs to that of bringing Honour to his Name; that as we should be thus inwardly affected towards God, so we should take all Opportunities of expressing the sense of our Minds, both by our Words and Actions; that we should therefore frequently address our selves to him, as to our God and Father, offering up our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Acknowledgments of his Infinite Perfections, and of our entire dependance upon him, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Thanks for all the expressions of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and our humble Petitions for a supply of all our Wants; and above all, that we should testifie our regard to him, by readily obeying all the Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52618:74"/>of his Will, which he hath any way given us; thus worshipping and serving him all our days, with Integrity of Heart and Life.</p>
                  <p>All that I have hitherto mention'd are Instances of Natural Religion towards God, and such as will be approv'd by every one, who seriously owns such a Being. For as for those few who call themselves Deists, and yet place the Almighty at such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from his Creatures, as to reckon it below him to concern his Providence about their particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and to account it an Indignity offer'd to God, and an impertinent Presumption in Men, for such inconsiderable Creatures as they are to make their applications and addresses to him upon all occasions, I think them hardly worth our consideration in this case. They contradict the sense not only of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Mankind, but of the wisest and soberest of Philosophers among the Pagans; they err from not considering the Nature of God and Man; and I shall take no farther notice of them, than by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to them this single Consideration, which I have in a former Lecture already suggested, That it cannot be unworthy of God, to concern himself for every Creature which he hath given Being to, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Nature; and that it is certainly fit for every Creature to demean it self towards its Maker, according to the Nature which he hath been pleas'd to give it. I shall therefore take it for granted, that whosoever acknowledges a God, and knows what he means by that acknowledgment, and at the same time considers the several Faculties with which Mankind are endow'd, will allow that all the above mention'd Instances, are parts of Natural
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52618:74"/>Religion. And that they are more particularly and fully express'd and urg'd by the Christian, than ever they were by any other Institution, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by any who have read the New Testament.</p>
                  <p>To which I might add, that the Gospel farther teacheth us, unfeignedly to repent of all our Offences committed against God, and to express this our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by an humble acknowledgment, an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sorrow, firm resolutions and faithful endeavours of amendment; all which, upon supposition of our being Sinners, are farther Instances of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion towards God; and they are what the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Revelation, upon that supposition, very much insists upon, withal encouraging us to hope for the Mercy and Favour of God, through the Mediation of our Redeemer, upon these terms.</p>
                  <p>And here is the transition from <hi>Natural</hi> Religion to <hi>Reveal'd.</hi> Christianity comes in here to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and assistance of Nature. For whereas from the Light of meer Reason, we could only have thought it our Duty to repent of our Sins, and so to have thrown our selves upon the undeserv'd, but infinite Goodness and Mercy of our Maker; but must have remain'd utterly uncertain how far, or in what way and manner he would have accepted our Repentance: the Gospel hath taught us to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress our selves to the great Father of all, in the Name, and through the Mediation of his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, cloath'd in our Nature, dying for our sakes, and living with him to make intercession for us. It hath eas'd our Minds in their searching after ways of expiating our Transgressions, and looking for Mediators to introduce us into the Presence and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52618:75"/>Favour of our offended Creator. It hath declar'd, that no other Expiation is necessary, but that which our Redeemer hath made for us; no Sacrifice for Sin acceptable, but that which he offer'd up upon the Cross once for all; and no other Intercession to be made use of, but that which he continually makes in Heaven on our behalf. It assures us, that all that is expected from us, is Repentance; and sincere, though imperfect Obedience; and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the exercise of these, we may surely depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mercy of God through this great <hi>Mediator.</hi> It accordingly enjoins us hence-forward to offer up all our Services, and to make all our Addresses in his Name, and to expect all good things from the Hands of our Heavenly Father, by the Mediation and Intercession of his Son Jesus Christ. After which our Religion hath throughly discharg'd us from all those external, ritual, and burdensome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances, which either the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the Superstition of the rest of Mankind had impos'd upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<note place="margin">John 4.24.</note> commanding us to <hi>worship God,</hi> who is <hi>a Spirit, in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> and appointing only two external Rites, both of them plain, easie, and I had almost said natural, being such as may be comply'd with, without the least difficulty, and are at the same time very proper to the purposes for which they were instituted; <hi>viz.</hi> one of them, the washing with Water in the Name of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity, at our admittance to the Christian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, representing that inward Purification which we profess to aim at; and the other, partaking of Bread broken, and Wine pour'd out, as a perpetual
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52618:75"/>Memorial of the great Sacrifice which our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor offer'd up for the remission of our Sins.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Gospel hath instructed us, as to our demeanour towards God; and all these its Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I dare venture to recommend to the serious Consideration of any one who in earnest pretends to the Religion of Nature and Reason; for altho', as I have already own'd, Christianity hath exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bounds of meer Natural Religion; yet all its Precepts are highly reasonable with respect to our present circumstances, since our Apostacy from God, as I think will fully appear from a due refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon what I have formerly urg'd, as to the necessity and use of a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and fallen Men.</p>
                  <p>I proceed in the next place,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To those Rules which the Christian Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath given us, as to our demeanour towards our Neighbour; that is, towards all of the same Nature with our selves;
<note place="margin">Luke 10.36.</note> for so far our Lord hath extended the signification of that word.</p>
                  <p>Now as to this point, the Gospel having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd, as I have already observ'd, <hi>the loving our Neighbour as our selves,</hi> it enjoyns by a necessary consequence, whatsoever can be expected from one Man towards another, according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of arguing upon this Subject;
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.8, 9.</note>
                     <hi>He that loveth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath fulfill'd the Law; for whatsoever Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is, it is briefly comprehended in this saying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.14.</note>
                     <hi>namely, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> And therefore lest any one should vainly pretend to love his Neighbour, without shewing his Love by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52618:76"/>the natural effects of it, our Lord enjoin'd his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the Act, in as plain and extensive terms, as he did the Principle;
<note place="margin">Matth. 7.12.</note>
                     <hi>All things whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you, do ye even so to them;</hi> telling them, that <hi>this is the Law, and the Prophets.</hi> We may add, <hi>This is the Gospel</hi> likewise.</p>
                  <p>For if we should run through the whole New Testament, we should find no Precepts more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more plentifully dispers'd throughout every Book of it, than those which require the strictest Truth, the most exact Justice, and the most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged Charity of all kinds. There we are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly instructed how to carry it to each other, in all the variety of Conditions and Circumstances of Humane Life, in every Relation and Capacity which we can be in; as Superiours, or Inferiours, or Equals; as in a private or in a publick Station; as Friends, or even towards those who will be without cause our Enemies; in all which Instances, we are taught to behave our selves both inoffensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and usefully; doing no manner of Evil; but all the Good that lyes in our Power. And though I will not say that the Christian Institution hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in impos'd upon us any thing new, any thing but what is truly natural, and therefore reasonable, if all things be duly consider'd; yet it must be own'd that it hath rais'd our Duty towards our Neighbour to an heighth, above what has been thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under any other Institution whatsoever. For through Weakness or Prejudice, the generality of Mankind, even those of the wiser and better sort, before the Revelation of the Gospel, did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the extent of our Obligation to some kinds of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52618:76"/>Charity, as is evident in the Instances of bearing Affronts, forgiving Injuries, loving of Enemies, and doing Good for Evil, in which the Gospel is so very express, and of which we meet with so little said to the purpose, even by the greatest Moralists. Nay, even the Jewish Law it self, though given by God, yet did not so expresly declare his Will, in these Instances, as the more perfect Law of Christ hath done; 'tis certain the <hi>Jews</hi> had not that sense of their Duty in these cases, which our Saviour endeavour'd to give them. For thus the Divine Author of our Religion discourseth to them upon this Argument; <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been said,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.38,</note>
                     <hi>An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth:
<note place="margin">39,</note>But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil.</hi> Again,
<note place="margin">43,</note>
                     <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and hate thine Enemy: But I say unto you,
<note place="margin">44,</note>Love your Enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully use you and persecute you:</hi> And all this,
<note place="margin">45,</note>
                     <hi>That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for he maketh the Sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth Rain on the just and on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.
<note place="margin">48.</note>Be ye therefore perfect</hi> (or <hi>merciful) even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> Here is Charity rais'd to its just heigth, even to a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of that which is in God himself, whom to imitate must needs be the Perfection of a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Head, Let any one carefully read over the Writings of the Evangelists and the Apostles, and he will find, that every particular Man is there taught to look upon himself as a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52618:77"/>Member of the universal Body of Men, and as in the first place to make the Glory of God his ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end, so next to that to aim at, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote as much as in him lyes, the Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; always to prefer the Publick Interest to his own Private Advantage; to entertain all possible Good-will, and to exercise all possible Kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards every Person of the same Kind and Nature with himself. All which Precepts so evidently tend to the benefit of the World, and the advantage of every particular Man, as well as to the peculiar sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and comfort of those who comply with them, that they must needs recommend the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution which enjoins them; as would appear to all the World beyond dispute, if we might once see them exemplified in a general Practice. But to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Argument compleat, I proceed to consider,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Rules which the Christian Revelation hath given us, with respect to the due government of our selves; and if these likewise prove as reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and useful as the former, we shall have a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation of our Christian Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now the sum of these is, that we should make it our daily care to improve our Spirits, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that end should keep our Bodies in due sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to them; that we should reduce our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Passions under the direction and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Understanding and Reason; that we should be modest and humble, as it becomes Creatures and Sinners; meek and patient, not apt to be discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with Events which are out of our power to appoint, or to be dissatisfied, and very uneasie, under
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52618:77"/>any Circumstances in which Providence shall think fit to place us; but to maintain a chearful, at least a contented temper of Spirit, in every state and condition of Life; that we should be temperate and chast, as those who are sensible that our Perfection and Happiness doth not consist in sensual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but in those which are spiritual; that we should entirely abstain from all the unnatural and unlawful Pleasures of Sense, and should be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the use of such as are natural and allowable; that we should eradicate all our corrupt Inclinations, resisting the first motions within us to Evil, and never in the least allowing that desire, which it is unlawful to bring into act; that we should disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle and loosen our Affections from this lower World, and all its Enjoyments, and raise them up by degrees to the things which are above, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of that superiour World for which we are principally design'd; that to this purpose we should frequently exercise our selves in acts of Self-denial and Mortification, by this means subduing our Flesh, and refining our Spirits, and so preparing and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying our selves for the Company, the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Pleasures of the Heavenly Regions.</p>
                  <p>All these are so evidently the Precepts of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, with respect to the management of our selves, that whosoever is conversant in the Holy Scriptures must be sensible that they are so. And indeed the Adversaries of our Religion are so far from denying it, that some of them, as I took notice, make it their grand Objection against the Christian Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it obligeth all who adhere to it, to such strict Rules, which, as they imagine, are too severe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52618:78"/>for Humane Nature, restraining and confining it within too narrow bounds, and not permitting it to enjoy its natural and reasonable Liberty. This they object in general against the Christian Precepts of Temperance and Chastity, especially of Self-denial and Mortification; and I question not but this is at the bottom the most prevailing Reason, why in a loose and corrupt Age so many have gone over to the part of Infidelity, namely, because they cannot perswade themselves heartily to comply with the Rules, which they plainly see the Gospel lays down in these Instances, and therefore judge it to be more decent before the World, as well as more easie to themselves, to reject this Revelation at once, than to live in open contradiction to what they should profess to believe.</p>
                  <p>There is one notorious Instance of this kind, which it may be proper here to take notice of, I mean the Christian Precepts which relate to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whereby one Man is restrain'd to one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and these two join'd together in so strict an Union, that it may not be allow'd to either of them to forsake the other upon any Reason, but the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Conjugal Faith. This some Men esteem a great Hardship; or, to speak in the Language of a Prophet of their own,
<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>As to the Christian Precepts of Temperance and Chastity in general, I doubt not to affirm, that they are really for the Good of Mankind even in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52618:78"/>this Life, as well as in order to the next, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sufficiently testifying, how much they conduce to the Health and Vigour of the Body, as well as the Ease and Satisfaction of the Mind, insomuch that a Wise Man, if <hi>he loves Life, and would see good Days,</hi> would chuse to be managed by them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Rules of Life, although they were not back'd by any Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>As to the exercises of Self-denial and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we find so frequently enjoin'd us by the Gospel, these also must be own'd to be sometimes absolutely necessary, very often highly expedient in this present state, in order to the rendering us Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of our selves. For considering the violence of some Mens Appetites and Passions, which they have rais'd to an exorbitant degree by long indulgence, it will be impossible for them ever to keep them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in tolerable bounds, without offering some Violence the other way. And therefore the best Moralists amongst the Pagans, do in the main agree with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity in this Point, making it the part of a wise and good Man, to govern his Appetites and Passions, and to use all fit and proper means to that end, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the very essence of Virtue in so doing.</p>
                  <p>And if the Christian Institution hath carried this matter farther, or press'd it closer, than the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists have ordinarily done, if it speaks of <hi>crucifying the Flesh with the Affections and Lusts,</hi> of <hi>cutting off a right-hand, and plucking out a right-eye,</hi> of being <hi>dead</hi> to the World and its Enjoyments, in fine, not only of <hi>denying our selves</hi> in general, but of <hi>taking up our Cross, and following our Lord,</hi> if it insists fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and with some vehemency upon these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52618:79"/>it still justifies it self fully, by founding these Practices upon such Principles, as will thorowly support them.</p>
                  <p>For it proceeds upon such suppositions as these following, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul of Man is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly immortal; that there will be certainly another Life infinitely more considerable than this is; that this is our state of tryal, in which we are to be train'd up, and fitted by degrees for that state to which we are passing; that the true way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the Future Life, is by improving our Spirits, subduing our Flesh, and loosening our selves from this vain World; that we shall be fully recompenc'd hereafter for whatsoever pains it may cost us in thus managing and disciplining our selves here; that <hi>it is profitable for us,</hi>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52618:79"/>appeal even to the Adversaries of our Religion themselves, to judge whether any thing can be more reasonable, than to comply with the Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which the Christian Institution hath given us, in the Instances I am now upon.</p>
                  <p>As to that part of the Objection, which more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly relates to Marriage, a plain Answer may likewise be given to it, upon the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. For supposing the History of our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents being form'd, and join'd together by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as <hi>Moses</hi> relates it, to be true, which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Revelation takes for granted, we have a plain Argument, that our Maker from the beginning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd and appointed all that the Gospel requires in this Instance. Our Saviour urgeth this Argument in the case of Divorce, when the <hi>Pharisees</hi> ask'd him,
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.3,</note>
                     <hi>Whether it were lawful for a Man to put away his Wife for every cause;</hi> He immediately referr'd them to the primitive Institution of Marriage, which may as well be urg'd against <hi>Polygamy,</hi> as against <hi>causeless Divorce. Have ye not read,</hi> saith he,
<note place="margin">4,</note>
                     <hi>that he who made them at the beginning, made them male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; and said,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">5,</note>
                     <hi>For this cause shall a Man leave Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, and shall cleave to his Wife, and they twain shall be one flesh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">6.</note>
                     <hi>Wherefore they are no more twain; but one flesh.</hi> Thus the Argument runs; God at the first made <hi>one Man,</hi> and <hi>one Woman,</hi> and he himself join'd them together in so strict an Union, as to declare them thence-forward to be but <hi>one.</hi> Why did he make no more Wives for <hi>Adam,</hi> than <hi>one;</hi> but that he intended it as a Pattern to all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity? And why did he so expresly declare the strict Union of these two; but in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52618:80"/>either the taking in a third, or the causeless separation of these?</p>
                  <p>And therefore 'tis remarkable, that <hi>Lamech,</hi> of the Posterity of <hi>Cain,</hi> is the first Man taken notice of as a Polygamist, it being said of him as a thing observable,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.19.</note> because singular, that <hi>he took unto him two Wives.</hi> Neither is it unlikely, that this was the beginning of degeneracy in the Family of <hi>Seth</hi> likewise, which seems to be intimated in that passage of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 6.2.</note>
                     <hi>The Sons of God saw the Daughters of Men, that they were fair, and they took them Wives of all which they chose.</hi> The Posterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> who had hitherto been worshippers of the true God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd to his Institutions, now broke loose, and join'd themselves in affinity with the Posterity of <hi>Cain,</hi> chusing them Wives as their humour and fancy led them, for their Beauty, not their Virtue, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably more than one, forsaking in this, as well as in other Instances the ancient Rule; upon which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows a farther account of their dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy into all manner of wickedness.</p>
                  <p>And hence we may learn the true Reason, why Polygamy prevail'd so generally throughout the World; namely, because the generality of Mankind were unacquainted with this ancient History of <hi>Moses;</hi> and the Tradition of the Primitive Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Marriage, was soon lost after the Flood. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed had it in their sacred Records, transmitted from <hi>Moses;</hi> but they did not thorowly consider it;
<note place="margin">Matth. 19.8.</note> and <hi>Moses</hi> on account of <hi>the hardness of their Hearts,</hi> their untractableness that is, and utter indisposition to comply with the Design and Law of God in Nature, did not particularly insist upon it.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52618:80"/>Tho' after all, the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> seems to refer them to the Pattern of Marriage in Paradice, when he accuses them of being unfaithful to the Conjugal Vow; <hi>Did not he make one,</hi> saith he,
<note place="margin">Mal. 2.15.</note>
                     <hi>yet had he the residue of the Spirit: and wherefore one? that he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your Spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the Wife of his youth.</hi> This,
<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Dr.</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. on</hi> Mal.</note> after all the Interpretations of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, seems the most natural and easie one, and accordingly to contain this plain sense; That God, who could as easily have made more Wives for <hi>Adam,</hi> yet gave him but One, that their mutual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Care of their Off-spring might be the greater; and that he design'd this as a Pattern for Posterity.</p>
                  <p>But however that may be, our Blessed Saviour, who <hi>came to fulfil the Law,</hi> by giving it its true sense and full scope, reviv'd this Sacred Institution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd it to what it was <hi>from the beginning,</hi> obliging his Disciples thence-forward to comply with it.</p>
                  <p>And indeed there is another plain Intimation of the Divine Pleasure concerning this matter, and that is the near Equality of the number of Males and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males born into the World, according to the best Observations that have been made, the advantage, (tho' not great) being on the side of the Males; which being a meer act of Providence, a matter that can be order'd by no other than Divine Appointment, seems a standing Declaration of the Will of God against Polygamy, and a confirmation of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Institution, as interpreted and urg'd by our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Besides all this, let but any Man weigh impartially, how much it conduces to the Felicity of Humane Life, that this Institution, both with respect to a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52618:81"/>single and indissoluble Marriage, should be observ'd, he will need no farther Argument to convince him. Nothing certainly can equally contribute to that entire Friendship and Confidence, which ought to be between a Man and his Wife, and the Comfort and Satisfaction which follows from thence, nothing so much to the careful and wise Education of their Off-spring, nothing so much to the Peace and good Order of the whole Family, and consequently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much to the Welfare of the Publick, which is begun in and founded upon that of each Family in particular.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this whole Argument. There is no Precept which the Gospel gives us relating to the good government of our selves, but what is either apparently reasonable at the first view, or must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily appear so, as soon as ever the Suppositions and Principles of Christianity are taken in and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.</p>
                  <p>Doth it, for Instance, require a greater degree of Humility, Meekness, Contentedness and Patience, than other Institutions of Religion, or than meer Philosophy hath done? 'Tis because at the same time it makes us more thorowly sensible of our own meanness and vileness; because it more fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to us the vast difference between this Life and that which is to come; because it more undoubtedly assures us of our entire dependance on the Divine Providence, and the certain and particular care it takes of us. Doth it again carry its Rules of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Chastity, of Self-denial and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to a greater height? 'Tis because it more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually convinceth us, that our Happiness consists in Spiritual Improvements and Entertainments, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52618:81"/>more plainly sets in our view the Pleasures and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the Future Life. Doth it finally lay a greater Restraint with respect to the Conjugal Bed, than the generality of Mankind have hitherto appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended necessary or expedient? 'Tis because it hath given a fuller account of the Designation of our Creator in this Instance, and because moreover it designs, whilst we are passing through this State, to prepare us for another,
<note place="margin">Matth. 22.30.</note> in which <hi>we shall neither marry, nor be given in Marriage, but be as the Angels of God.</hi> So that the true Reason why any Man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects against these Precepts must be, because he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders things by halves, and does not take in the whole Scheme of Christianity at once. If we would but join its Principles and its Precepts together, we should be forc'd to acknowledge that all its Precepts, whether relating to God, our Neighbour, or our selves, are <hi>holy, just, and good,</hi> reasonable in their own Nature, fit for us in our present Circumstances, apparently conducive to the Good of Mankind in general, as well as to the Benefit and Satisfaction of every particular Man, both in this Life, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>May we, who profess to own their Authority, take care also to make them the standing Rules of our Tempers and our Practices. So shall we resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our great Lord and Master, whose <hi>Life,</hi> as it was <hi>a Pattern</hi> for our Instruction and Imitation, will fall next under Consideration; and by this means also we shall most effectually recommend our holy Profession to Unbelievers, forcing them, upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the good Fruits of it, to confess, to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God and our Mediator, that <hi>This is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful saying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>IN my former Lectures upon these Words, I have made it my business to shew, that the <hi>Saying</hi> here recommended by the Apostle, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it an intrinsick Evidence; the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, in which our Lord Jesus Christ hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Salvation of Sinners, being suited to the most just and reasonable Apprehensions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. He took upon him the Office of a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Men, in the execution of which Office, and in order to the reconciling Men to God, it was requisite, as I have observ'd, that amongst other things he should perfectly instruct Men in the Knowledge of God, and of themselves, and of the several particulars of their Duty. That he hath done this by the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which he taught, I have already prov'd, and am now farther to shew, that he hath added to his <hi>Doctrine</hi> an exact and perfect <hi>Example,</hi> thereby more fully to instruct us in all the particulars before-mention'd, as also to excite and encourage us to a Practice agreeable to our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52618:84"/>
                  <p>Had our Blessed Saviour left us only the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Precepts recorded in the New Testament, this had been a sing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>There was in truth since the general Corruption of Mankind both in their Tempers and Manners, very great need of some Pattern to be set us, of a Person in our own Nature, demeaning himself in all things according to the Will of God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the design of that Nature which he hath given us. Now such a Pattern is propos'd to us in the Person of our blessed Saviour, who <hi>left us an Example,</hi>

                     <hi>that we should follow his steps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In treating on this Argument, I must necessarily take my Idea of the Temper and Practice of our Saviour, from the History of the New Testament, and more particularly of the Evangelists, who, 'tis evident, wrote on purpose, that they might leave to the World a particular and standing Record thereof. And who indeed could do it so well, as they who converst intimately and constantly with him, or received their information immediately from them who did so? And in whom may we more reasonably confide, than in those, who as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52618:84"/>men of great Simplicity and Integrity whilst they liv'd, so upon all occasions expos'd their lives in Testimony of the Truth of what they Preach'd and Wrote?</p>
                  <p>But I think I need make no Apology for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upon their History, since it was not denied by the most Learned Adversaries of Christianity, when it first appear'd in the World, nor will be I presume by the Infidels of the present Age, that the Condition and Manner of our Saviour's Life were such as the Evangelists have declar'd.</p>
                  <p>If I were to insist upon his Miraculous Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all the extraordinary Circumstances which attended both that and his Nativity, or upon the several Miracles affirm'd to be wrought by him dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of his publick Ministry, or his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, and Ascension into Heaven, it would then be necessary for me to vindicate the truth of those matters of Fact: but forasmuch as my present business is to consider either the external Circumstances, or the Moral dispositions and actions of our Saviour, whilst he dwelt upon Earth, I may I think take it for granted, that the Truth of the History will be thus far allow'd me; especially, since the Adversaries of Christianity pretend to make their advantage from the meanness of our Saviour's Circumstances, and some of them endeavour also to improve some passages of his behaviour, as related by the Evangelists, into objections against the truth of his Religion; but how justly, will appear when we have more throughly consider'd the Argument we are upon.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52618:85"/>
                  <p>There are therefore as I have already hinted, these <hi>two</hi> general heads to be consider'd with respect to the Life of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The External Condition and Circumstances of his Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The manner of his behaviour in these Circumstances, <hi>viz.</hi> his Moral Dispositions and Actions; the former, as an act of the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in so ordering the condition of our Saviour's Life upon Earth, as that it might prove an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Example to Mankind; and the latter, as an instance of our Saviour's Wisdom and Goodness in demeaning himself so, as might best serve to the same purpose. The former of these I shall consider more briefly, and the latter more at large.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Let us take into Consideration the External Condition and Circumstances of our Saviour's Life.</p>
                  <p>Now as to this, 'tis agreed on all hands, that his Condition of Life was in the esteem of the World extremely mean and obscure. He was born of a poor Woman, who was Espoused to a Man of an honest, but mean occupation. His first lodging was in a Stable,

The Countrey in which he had his Abode and Education, during his private Life, was <hi>Galilee,</hi> out of which it was thought no <hi>Prophet could arise,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 7.52. John 1.46.</note> much less the <hi>Messiah.</hi> His Town was <hi>Nazareth,</hi> concerning which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52618:85"/>made it a question, whether <hi>any good thing could come out of it.</hi> His Condition through the whole course of his Life was without either Wealth or secular Honour, nay attended with Poverty and Disgrace. He did, for the first <hi>Thirty</hi> years of his Life, live, as far as appears, with <hi>Joseph,</hi> or, if <hi>Joseph</hi> died within that space, with <hi>Mary,</hi> following the Occupation of his supposed Father, insomuch that the <hi>Jews</hi> stil'd him, not only <hi>the Carpenters Son,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 13.55. Mark 6.3.</note> but <hi>the Carpenter.</hi> When he enter'd upon his Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employment, he took no State upon him. He had no settled Habitation, nor certain Provision.
<note place="margin">Mat. 8.19, 20.</note> He told one who offer'd to follow him, that <hi>the Foxes had holes, and the Birds of the air had nests; but the Son of Man had not where to lay his Head.</hi> He liv'd upon the Charity of his Friends; for so we read of <hi>certain Women,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 8.3.</note> who were wont <hi>to minister unto him of their substance.</hi> He was moreover continually Despis'd, Malign'd, and Persecuted, and at last Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a cruel Death, as a Malefactor, with all the Circumstances of Indignity.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we Christians say, and firmly believe, that our Lord was amply recompens'd for submitting to these mean and despicable Circumstances, by favors conferr'd upon him by the Divine Providence even in this Life, and much more by his Exaltation in Heaven after his Resurrection. As for instance, that although his Mother was a poor Woman, yet she was a Person of Exemplary Prudence, Virtue, and Piety, which are of much greater account with God, than Wealth and Honour; that he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and Born of her, whilst a pure Virgin, by the immediate Influence of the Almighty; that he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52618:86"/>was constantly under the special Care and Conduct of the Divine Providence; that there were several Divine Messages and Oracles relating to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, his Nativity, and his following Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that the Shepherds which visited him were sent by Angels; that some Learned and Inquisitive, and 'tis likely Honourable and Wealthy Persons, were by the Guidance of an extraordinary Star con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from a Foreign Countrey, to pay their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to him, as <hi>a King;</hi> that he was not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Angels upon all extraordinary Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but receiv'd special Communications and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences from God himself; that his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was endued with the Divine Spirit <hi>without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>

                     <hi>by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the dead.</hi> These are such things as, if believ'd by the Adversaries of the Christian Faith, would even in <hi>their</hi> judgment entirely take off the reproach of his External Circumstances. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as my Method forbids me to consider these particulars, I wave them all, and do assert that the very Obscurity and Meanness of our Saviour's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, during his sojourning upon Earth, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd as a proper means for our Instruction.</p>
                  <p>It was in truth a most severe censure past upon the Pride and Luxury of men, and a powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to convince us of the Vanity and Emptiness of this World, for the Son of God to accept of no better entertainment in it.</p>
                  <p>Mankind were sunk into an animal and sensual Life, and degenerated into a very inordinate admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52618:86"/>and love of the World. An high Birth, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Rank and Quality, Honour, Wealth, and Pleasure, these were become the Idols of Men, whereby not only their Affections were entangled, but their very Judgments also corrupted. So that nothing could be more expedient, than that He, whom Providence design'd for an Instructor and Example to Mankind, He who was sent to rectifie both their Judgments and their Dispositions, should by the very manner of his appearance amongst them, openly testifie his disregard to all these things, being not only destitute of those Enjoyments, in which depraved Men are so apt to place their Felicity, but moreover expos'd to those Hardships and Sufferings, which they falsly account the worst of Evils, thus confirming by his own Example, what he taught by his Doctrine. 'Tis a known and memorable Passage of <hi>Plato,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was indeed this Condition which render'd our Blessed Saviour capable of exemplifying those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Virtues, which otherwise he could not have had occasion or opportunity to exercise, such as were most directly opposite to the Vices into which Men were degenerated, such as were most useful and necessary for Men to exercise in this present life, and such as it is most difficult for us in this degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and corrupt Estate to attain to; <hi>viz.</hi> a firm

                  <p>Nay allowing what we Christians assert, that the Son of God voluntarily took upon him our Nature, and freely submitted to this condition of Humane Life, our Saviour did hereby farther express his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most contempt of this vain World, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The greater part of Mankind are placed in a low and mean Condition, and stand in need especially of those Virtues which are proper to such a state. So that our Saviour by exemplifying the Virtues requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to that Condition, became in the first place a Pattern to the greatest number of Men; and if we take in the consideration which I just now mention'd, of his voluntary submission to this State for our sakes, he at the same time propos'd himself as an eminent Pattern to the Great and Rich Men of the World likewise. Thus the Apostle argues, improving this Example of our Lord, to perswade to Humility and Charity.

                     <hi>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, —emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied himself, taking upon him the form of a Servant, being made in the likeness of men,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I should now pass to the other general Head which I propos'd; but that I may leave no difficulty in the way, it may be proper first to obviate an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that may be rais'd with respect to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which the Evangelists have given us of our Saviour's Life; <hi>viz.</hi> That a considerable part of it is past over in silence, there being very little left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record concerning him till the Thirtieth Year of his Age, when he enter'd upon his publick Ministry,
<note place="margin">Luke 3.23.</note> in which he is supposed to have continued no longer than Three Years and an half: whereas, had he been design'd as a Pattern to Mankind, we might rather have expected a full and particular account of all that was said or done by him, from his Birth to his Death. To this I reply in the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>If we were not able to assign the just Reasons for this proceeding,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it ought not however to pass for a reasonable Objection in this Case. For allowing (what is undeniably true) that the Adversaries of Christianity have nothing to lay to our Saviour's charge during his private Life, and (what I shall prove hereafter) that when he did appear in publick, his practice was highly Exemplary; 'tis sufficient. God might design him for a publick Example, for what space of time he pleas'd, and that for very wise and good Reasons, which we may not be able to guess at. And although, if we had all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons recorded from the beginning of his Life to the end, there would be more instances for our Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Imitation; yet during that time in which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52618:88"/>he exercised his publick Ministry, there might be enough to answer these ends.</p>
                  <p>I add, that from the short and general account which the Evangelists have given us of the more private and retired part of our Saviour's Life,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we have reason to look upon him, as a great Example of divers eminent Virtues, even during that State. <hi>He went down</hi> (from <hi>Jerusalem) with Joseph and Mary, and was subject to them,</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us. This at first view was a Life of Innocency and honest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
<note place="margin">Luke 2.51.</note> spent in the constant exercise of Humility, Contentedness, Submission and Resignation to his Heavenly Father, and Obedience and Subjection not only to his real, but also to his reputed Earthly Parent; Virtues all of them necessary for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of Mankind, and, as Experience teaches us, not easily attain'd and exercis'd by them. And if here again we take in the consideration of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Person, who, (as we Christians affirm) voluntarily subjected himself to this way of living, we shall still discover, that even this part of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Life was farther Exemplary to us. For what could be a greater instance of wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension and Goodness (as I observ'd before) than for the Son of God, for our sakes, to cloath himself with Humane Flesh, not to abhor the Virgins Womb, to pass through the States of Infancy and Childhood, to grow and improve by degrees, and, in a word, to accommodate himself to all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies and infirmities of innocent Humanity? And how could he more effectually have exprest to us his contempt of this vain World, than by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting freely to all those mean Circumstances, with which this part of his Life was attended?</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52618:88"/>
                  <p>I observe farther that there were not wanting Instances,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which all along discover'd him to be an extraordinary Person, such as were sufficient to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Eyes of Men towards him, and to prepare them by degrees for an acknowledgement of him, when he should make a more Publick appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>I shall not insist upon those Oracular Dreams, and Angelical Apparitions, by which the Evangelists tell us he was made known to the blessed Virgin, to <hi>Joseph,</hi> and to the Shepherds,

                     <hi>the Child grew, and waxed strong in Spirit,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52618:89"/>filled with Wisdom, and the Grace of God was upon him;</hi> and again upon his return thither at Twelve Years of Age, that <hi>he increas'd in Wisdom, and in Stature,</hi>

                     <hi>and in favor with God and Man;</hi> both which expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions plainly signifie, that as he grew up from a Child to a Man, there appear'd a singular and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree of Wisdom and Goodness in him, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so extraordinary, as to mark him out for an especial Favorite of God, and to render him admir'd and belov'd by all that converst with him.</p>
                  <p>It is generally assign'd as a probable account of our Saviour's forbearing to exercise his publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, till he enter'd upon his <hi>Thirtieth</hi> Year,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that this was in correspondence with the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> given to the <hi>Levites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 4.3.</note> by which though he were not oblig'd, yet it was agreeable to his practice in other cases, thus <hi>to fulfil all righteousness,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 3.15.</note> namely beginning his Ministry at the Age, at which the Ministers of God in that Nation were appointed to begin theirs. But,</p>
                  <p>As a closer Answer to this Objection I add,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that an apparent, and a sufficient Reason why our Lord did not expose himself to more publick view and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation for a longer space of time, than we are told he did, and consequently the just account, why we have not any particular Record of the former part of his Life, is this, that the time of his publick appearance and Ministry was full as long as that untoward Generation could bear it. The Life which he was design'd to live was not what they expected in their <hi>Messiah, viz.</hi> a Life of secular Pomp and Grandure; but a serious, humble, self-denying, a devout, and truly good Life, directly contrary to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52618:90"/>the Manners, as well as the Notions of that Age, and therefore he no sooner began to make himself publickly known, but they presently malign'd and persecuted him, insomuch that he was forc'd often to withdraw himself from them, and by many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of prudent management to decline their fury, till he knew <hi>their hour</hi> was fully come. So that had he appear'd sooner, he had been so much the sooner cut off. It was therefore the natural consequence of the evil temper of that generation of Men, which God did not think fit miraculously to over-rule, that our Saviour's Example was of no longer stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>To take off this Objection entirely,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> I add, that the Example which he hath left us, and which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the New Testament, was such as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to answer the design and end of it, as will I hope fully appear from the other general Head I proposed to be spoken to, and to which I now proceed, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To consider the manner of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's behaviour, or the Moral dispositions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Life, with the several Virtues which he exemplifyed to us thereby. And here I am sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I have a very copious Subject; but I shall reduce what I have to offer upon this Argument to as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a compass as I can.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin with observing that the Life of our Blessed Saviour was truly Humane,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I mean, such as was suited to the frame and condition of Humane Nature, and therefore fit to be proposed as a Pattern to Mankind.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52618:90"/>
                  <p>As he was made in all things like unto us, sin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted; so abating only those instances, in which he acted as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or rather as the <hi>Messiah,</hi> he acted just as it becomes us to do, affecting no Singularities, running into no Extravagancies, doing nothing but what was perfectly agreeable to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, as it is of God's Creation.</p>
                  <p>He did not pretend to a Stoical Apathy; but as he had, so he freely discover'd the several innocent Affections and Passions, which are in other Men. He not only Hunger'd and Thirsted, was Weary and Faint; but he also Lov'd and Pity'd, Rejoyc'd and Sorrow'd and Wept, and was angry too upon Just occasion. <hi>John</hi> is often stiled,
<note place="margin">John 13.23.</note>
                     <hi>the Disciple whom Jesus lov'd.</hi> He <hi>lov'd</hi> the rest of his Disciples, as we are assur'd by the same Evangelist;
<note place="margin">v. 1.</note> but that Disciple with a singular and special affection; and the same is said with respect to <hi>Laz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                     <note place="margin">John 11.5.</note> and his two Sisters. At the return of the Seventy Disciples, and their relating the success which they had, we are told that <hi>Jesus rejoyc'd in Spirit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10.21.</note> When he went with a full resolution to raise his friend <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> from the dead,
<note place="margin">John 11.33.</note> yet seeing <hi>Mary and the Jews which were with her weeping,</hi> 'tis said, that <hi>he groan'd in Spirit and was troubled;</hi> and when he came to the place where he was lay'd, he so far sympathiz'd with the Company, as <hi>to weep</hi> also,
<note place="margin">35,</note>which caus'd some of them to say, <hi>Behold, how he lov'd him!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">36.</note>His Compassion is frequently made the occasion and the motive of his doing good both to the Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men. For so the Evangelist observes, that <hi>when he saw much people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 6.34 &amp;c.</note>
                     <hi>he was mov'd with compassion towards them, because they were as sheep not having a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52618:91"/>shepherd, and began</hi> first <hi>to teach them many things,</hi> and presently afterward wrought a Miracle to feed them. It was from the same Motive, that he rais'd the Widow's only Son, when he met his Body as it was carried out of the City to be buried, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Mother weeping.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 7.13. Luke 19.41.</note>
                     <hi>When he beheld the City of Jerusalem,</hi> and consider'd the evils that were many years after to befall it, he was so tenderly affected as <hi>to weep over it,</hi> and in very pathetical words to express his Grief for the Obstinacy and the Misery of its Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>Nay he did not take upon him to be insensible of his own Sufferings. He had very quick and pungent Apprehensions of them before-hand, with a mixture of all the innocent Passions which are wont to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company such apprehensions; he own'd his natural aversion to them, and utter'd very affecting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> them, as all the Evangelists assure us; by all which, provided he retain'd a just firmness and constancy of Mind, together with a becoming Submission and Resignation (as it will hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear he did) he became so much the fitter Example to us, who by the frame of our Natures are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably liable to the like Affections and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Nor did he only accommodate himself to us in expressing these more tender passions of Humane Nature; but he thought it not below him to be sometimes angry also. 'Tis expresly said, that <hi>he look'd round about upon the Pharisees with anger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 3.5.</note>
                     <hi>being griev'd for the hardness of their hearts;</hi> and upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other just occasions, we find the same Passion mov'd in him, towards that Hypocritical and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52618:91"/>malicious Generation of Men. Nay in a lower degree, he was sometimes angry with his Disciples also, as particularly with <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 16.23.</note> when he would have tempted him to decline the Sufferings appointed for him.</p>
                  <p>As a farther proof of our Saviour's Life being truly Humane, 'tis observable that he had nothing peculiar in his way of living, in his Diet, his Habit, or the manner of his Conversing in the World. Our Lord himself takes notice of this, when he compares his own Life with that of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and mentions the Remarks which the <hi>Jews</hi> made both upon the one and the other.
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.18.19.</note> John <hi>came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and sinners.</hi> As the Habit of <hi>John</hi> was peculiar, so his Diet was singular and spare, and his Conversation reserv'd. On the contrary our blessed Saviour appear'd, and eat and drank, and convers'd, as other grave and sober Men did, he frequented the usual places of resort, walk'd publickly through their Villages and Cities, talk'd freely with all sorts of people, eat with Publicans and Sinners, to the great offence of the Pharisees; and with the Pharisees too,
<note place="margin">Luke 5.29.</note> who, as he assures us, were much more unworthy of his Company. He accepted invitations,
<note place="margin">chap. 19.5.</note> nay sometimes invited himself to their Houses.</p>
                  <p>He lead indeed a single Life, as that which was most suitable to his high vocation; but he gave no other Precept to his Disciples, with respect to their chusing that state, but only in those Words,
<note place="margin">Matth. 19.11, 12.</note>
                     <hi>He that is able to receive this saying, let him
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52618:92"/>receive it,</hi> having said just before, that <hi>all men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive it, save they to whom it is given.</hi> And to shew how far he was from censuring or despising those who liv'd in lawful and chast Wedlock, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted an invitation to a Marriage, and wrought his first Miracle in favour of the Bridegroom and his Company.
<note place="margin">John 2.2, 11.</note> To which might be added the special Notice he took, and the tender Affection he exprest to <hi>young Children,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 10.13.</note>
                     <hi>taking them up in his arms, putting his hands upon them, and blessing them,</hi> and being <hi>much displeas'd with his Disciples</hi> for judging them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his regard.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this particular, He did not retire from the World, nor leave the Society of Mankind under the pretence of Devotion, but as he withdrew at convenient times,
<note place="margin">Matth. 14.23. Luke 6.12.</note> usually in the Evening or at Night, for the more private exercises of Piety, so he commonly spent the day in doing good to Men, esteeming Charity one of the best and surest Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Piety, as will appear farther hereafter. We read indeed of his retiring into the Wilderness, and abiding there forty days: but this was once for all, by an extraordinary impulse of that Spirit, which had newly anointed him to his high Office, and in order to the preparing him for the due discharge of it; and therefore as in this instance he is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to us as our Pattern, so in all that part of his Life in which he is so propos'd, we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it; but as his Instructions and Rules of Life were plain and intelligible, so the instances of his Piety and Virtue were natural and imitable. But to proceed,</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52618:92"/>
                  <p>Although the Life of our Saviour was thus Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, yet it was perfectly innocent and inoffensive;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> nay according to true reason, notwithstanding the perverse Judgment of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive, for being Humane, nothing being more apt to offend Persons of sound Judgment and honest meaning, than needless and affected singularity, or a vain pretence to something that is truly unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He did no sin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.22.</note> saith one who was well acquainted with him, and who laid down his life for his sake. He was <hi>holy, harmless, undefil'd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7.26.</note>
                     <hi>separate from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> saith another, who had reason to know his Character. But these were his Friends; had his Enemies nothing to lay to his Charge? He was so conscious of his Innocency, that he durst make his open appeal to the worst of them, all at once.
<note place="margin">John 8.46.</note>
                     <hi>Which of you convinceth me of Sin?</hi> They frequently <hi>lay'd wait for him, seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him;</hi> but all in vain,
<note place="margin">Luke 11.54.</note> his words being as unblameable as his actions. 'Tis true, they sometimes lay'd to his Charge the worst of Crimes, representing him as a Blasphemer, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, a loose and prophane Man, dangerous to the Government, and guilty of Treason against <hi>Caesar.</hi> But all this, when the grounds of their Accusation are consider'd, appears evidently, the result either of gross Ignorance, or perverse Malice.</p>
                  <p>He was no otherwise a Blasphemer or an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, but as he took upon him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or <hi>Son of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5.36, 39.</note> for the proof of which he appeals both to their own Scriptures, and to the Works which he wrought amongst them. The instances of his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52618:93"/>Loosness and Prophaneness were, his doing Works of Charity and Mercy on the Sabbath day, and his conversing with <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> in order to the making them better Men; as to which he vindicates his practice unanswerably in several Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses with them, wherein I am sure any serious Deist will allow him to have argued with great Wisdom, and to have been much too hard for his Accusers. For he plainly shews them, that they had not consider'd the practice of the best and most considerable Members of their own Church,
<note place="margin">Mat. 12.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> in the like cases; nay that they did not reflect upon their own practice, and therefore would not allow him to do as much for a <hi>Man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 13.15.</note> as themselves would do for an <hi>Ox</hi> or an <hi>Asse,</hi> on the Sabbath day; that they did not understand the reason and design of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath's being Instituted; that they were wholly Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the distinction between <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Positive</hi> Precepts;
<note place="margin">Matth. 9.13.</note> and finally that they had not yet learn'd the meaning of that passage in their own Scriptures, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</hi> As to his being dangerous to the Government, or guilty of Treason against <hi>Caesar,</hi> he ever carefully declin'd what might but look that way. He would not upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion intermeddle in Secular Affairs, and therefore when <hi>one desir'd him but to speak to his brother to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the inheritance with him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 12.13, 14.</note> he replied, <hi>Man who made me a Judge or a Divider over you?</hi> When he perceiv'd the People, apprehending him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 6.15.</note> would have set him up for their <hi>King,</hi> he immediately withdrew from amongst them. When his Enemies put a Question to him, concerning <hi>pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tribute to Caesar,</hi> with a design only to ensnare
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52618:93"/>him, though for that reason he gave them an answer only in general terms, such as they could lay no hold on to his disadvantage,
<note place="margin">Luke 20.25.</note> yet it was such as seem'd evidently to favour the paying it; and he did at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time pay Tribute for himself and <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 17.27.</note> at the Expence of a Miracle, which whether it were to the use of the Temple, or to <hi>Caesar,</hi> was however an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance (as our Saviour himself makes it) of his care <hi>not to offend.</hi> When <hi>Pilate</hi> examin'd him about his being a <hi>King,</hi> he tells him,
<note place="margin">John 18.36.</note> that <hi>his Kingdom was not of this world,</hi> and assigns that as the Reason why <hi>his Servants were not to fight for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this particular; as during the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time of his Ministry, he escap'd falling into their hands, because they could find nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to accuse him; so when they were at last deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd right or wrong to cut him off, we are told, that <hi>they sought false witnesses against him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 26.59, 60. Mark 14.59.</note>
                     <hi>but found none: yea, though many came, yet found they none</hi> that could <hi>agree</hi> in their Evidence. But this is said by his Friends. Be it so; but the thing speaks it self. The matter alledged by the <hi>two</hi> that appear'd against him, was a manifest misinterpretation of his Words, they applying to the <hi>Temple,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 2.21.</note> what he spake of his own <hi>Body.</hi> And after all, the High-Priest was able to find nothing to charge him with, but what he own'd himself,
<note place="margin">Matth. 26.63, 64, 65.</note> out of Reverence to the Name of God, by which he was adjur'd, namely, that he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> or the <hi>Messiah.</hi> As for <hi>Pilate,</hi> he openly declar'd his Innocency, in most full and emphatical Terms.
<note place="margin">Luke 23.13, 14, 15.</note> For <hi>when he had call'd together the chief Priests, and the Rulers, and the People, he said unto them, Ye have brought this Man unto me, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52618:94"/>one that perverteth the people; and behold, I having examin'd him before you, find no fault in this Man, touching those things whereof ye accuse him; no nor yet Herod,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. 20, 22.</note> &amp;c. And he repeats it a second and a third time, expostulating the matter with them, <hi>Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him.</hi> And at last, when he was prevail'd upon against his Conscience, to give him up into their hands, to shew that it was his settled Judgment, that he was Innocent,
<note place="margin">Matth. 27.24.</note>
                     <hi>he took water, and wash'd his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the bloud of this just Person: see ye to it.</hi> And what could have been a fuller vindication of our Lord, than this was?</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, that there are some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages related by the Evangelists themselves, which seem liable to exception, such as these following, <hi>viz.</hi> Our Saviour's allowing and justifying his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, in their deviating from what may seem an innocent Custom, taken up from the Tradition of their Fathers, and generally practis'd by the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, namely, <hi>to wash their hands before eating;</hi> and not only so, but severely rebuking and upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scribes and Pharisees upon that occasion. Likewise his riding in a kind of Triumph into <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and when he came thither taking upon him Authority, and by force driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple. Farthermore, his speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opprobriously of King <hi>Herod,</hi> saying, <hi>Go and tell that Fox.</hi> And lastly, his putting his Disciples in Mind of providing themselves with Swords, a little before his being Apprehended. These are all the Passages which I can recollect, which can with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52618:94"/>any pretence be Objected against what I have been alledging, of the Inoffensiveness of our Saviour's Life; of each of which I shall give a plain account in few words.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Three</hi> first, I take them to be so many instances, in which our Saviour acted not as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Person; but as One who had receiv'd a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Commission from God, as he was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> nay, much more than a <hi>Prophet,</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> and <hi>Son of God,</hi> and as such he us'd a Freedom, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd an Authority, which might indeed prove offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, but yet very well became his Character.</p>
                  <p>When he allow'd his Disciples in their <hi>transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Tradition of the Elders,</hi>

                     <hi>not washing their hands when they did eat bread,</hi> 'tis plain, that he did not account the practice of the Scribes and Pharisees in that instance to be innocent. They used that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony superstitiously, laying a great stress upon it, as if it had been expresly commanded by God, nay as if it had some Moral Goodness in it, and <hi>to eat with unwashen</hi> hands really <hi>defil'd a man.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 10, 11.</note> For this Reason our Lord is said to have <hi>call'd the multitude, and said unto them, Hear and understand. Not that which goeth into the Mouth defiles a Man: but that which cometh out of the Mouth, this defileth a Man.</hi> Nay, they did not only urge this, and other of their Traditions, as necessary to be observ'd, <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Doctrines, the Commandments of men;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 9.</note> but as he farther tells them, <hi>they transgrest</hi> even the plainest and most indispensable <hi>Commands of God, by their Traditions;</hi>

                     </note> for which he chargeth them with gross Hypocrisie, and rebukes them severely. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it very well became him, if he were the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52618:95"/>
                     <hi>Messiah,</hi> to rectifie the Peoples Apprehensions in a matter of this great importance, and to teach them wherein Purity or Holiness did consist; as likewise openly to expose the Ignorance and the Hypocrisie of those <hi>blind Guides,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 14.</note> as he there calls them. And therefore when <hi>his Disciples</hi> upon that occasion <hi>said to him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 12, 13.</note>
                     <hi>Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying? He answered and said, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</hi> We never read, that either he did himself, or allow'd his Disciples to transgress any <hi>Divine</hi> Law, rightly understood; so far from that, that he complied with all <hi>Humane</hi> Institutions, that were truly innocent. We meet with no Objection made against his Behaviour in the <hi>Temple,</hi> or in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> to which he constantly resorted, though there were many Usages in both those places, which had no other foundation but Humane Institution or Custom.
<note place="margin">John 10.22.</note> He celebrated <hi>the Feast of Dedication,</hi> which is known to have been appointed by Men, not by God. Nay he else-where admonish'd <hi>his Disciples and the multitude,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 23.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> that since <hi>the Scribes and Pharisees sat in Moses's seat, all therefore whatsoever they bid them observe, (viz.</hi> as far as it was agreeable to <hi>Moses,</hi> whose Interpreters they were, or should have a fair probability of being so, even though they impos'd <hi>heavier burdens</hi> than <hi>Moses</hi> ever intended, as the Words following seem to imply, yet if it were within the bounds of innocent practice) <hi>that</hi> they should <hi>observe and do,</hi> though <hi>not do after their works; for they said, and did not;</hi> where he carefully distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd between the <hi>Men,</hi> and their <hi>Office,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing respect to be shew'n to the one, when it was not due to the other.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52618:95"/>
                  <p>As to our Lord's Riding in a kind of Triumph into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a little before his Crucifixion,
<note place="margin">Mat. 21.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> 'tis evident, that he then own'd himself the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by taking upon him to fulfil a Prophesie relating to him: but he did it in such manner as to shew plainly, that he prerended not to an Earthly Kingdom, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to give the Civil Power the least distusbance. Thus the Text sufficiently intimates, as the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist eitus it from the Prophet,
<note place="margin">ver. 4, 5.</note>
                     <hi>Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,</hi> How! Not as the Kings of the Earth, in Pomp and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; but <hi>meek</hi> (or <hi>lowly) sitting upon an ass, and a colt the fole of an ass;</hi> not usher'd in with Guards of Souldiers; but with the Acclamations of the well-meaning and unarmed Multitude. And when he was come into the City, all the Authority he there exercised, was, where it was proper for him to do it, in <hi>his Father's house,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 12.</note> driving out of the Temple those that had profan'd it, which he must reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be understood to have done, as he was <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And indeed from the Success he had, in their leaving the Temple without resistance, both upon this and a former occasion, when he exercis'd the same Authority, it may well be inferr'd,
<note place="margin">John 2.14.</note> that both his Commission and his Power were in these instances extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>As to his styling <hi>Herod, that Fox,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 13.32.</note> it admits of the same answer. Whosoever is sent with a special Commission from God, is in the execution of that Commission greater than the greatest Prince upon Earth. This no reasonable Man will deny; and that our Lord in this instance took upon him to be thus Commission'd, is evident from the account
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52618:96"/>which the Evangelist here gives.
<note place="margin">Luke 13.31, 32, 33.</note> When <hi>the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> bad him <hi>depart thence,</hi> because <hi>Herod would kill him, he said to them, Go ye and tell that Fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected: Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a Prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</hi> Where he styles himself <hi>a Prophet,</hi> lays claim to a Miraculous Power, and declares himself appointed to discharge an Office, which he should continue to do till the time determin'd of God was come.</p>
                  <p>As to the remaining Instance, whosoever will consider the Text fairly, will easily be satisfied, that our Saviour's meaning was not to put his Disciples upon providing Swords for his defence,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.36.</note> but only by a Symbolical way of speaking, to forewarn them of the distresses to which they were presently to be expos'd. For he had no sooner said, <hi>He that hath no Sword, let him sell his Garment and buy one;</hi> but he immediately adds,
<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Lord, behold here are two Swords,</hi> he reply'd, <hi>It is enough.</hi> Had he design'd to make use of their assistance for his defence, it had not been <hi>enough</hi> to have had <hi>two Swords;</hi> but by this short answer, he intimated, that he meant no such thing; as 'tis certain he did not, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52618:96"/>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> to sheath his Sword,
<note place="margin">ver. 50, 51.</note> as soon as he had drawn it; and his healing the Wound which it had made. So that notwithstanding the several Objections above mention'd, we may justly affirm, that our Saviour's demeanour was truly Innocent and Inoffensive.</p>
                  <p>There was farther observable in the Life of our Saviour perfect Simplicity and Integrity,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> mix'd with exact Prudence.</p>
                  <p>I joyn these together, as being rarely found in the same Person; but in our Blessed Saviour they were so perfectly joyn'd, as neither of them in the least to intrench upon the other.</p>
                  <p>His Simplicity and Integrity appear'd, in his free and open Conversing with all sorts of people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other design but the doing good to their Souls or Bodies. Whosoever came to him with an honest desire to be instructed, he readily admitted them, and discours'd plainly with them, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the informing their Judgments or directing their Practice. He instructed his Disciples upon all occasions, in such Truths as might be useful to them, resolving their doubts, and explaining to them what they did not well apprehend at the first hearing. He never flatter'd them with vain hopes of Secular Preferments; but often forewarn'd them of his own and their Sufferings. He treated them with that Freedom, which, as he himself told them, was us'd towards <hi>Friends,</hi> not <hi>Servants,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 15.26.</note> discovering to them as much of the Will of God, as they could bear to know. When at any time they misbehav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, he admonish'd and reprov'd them, always
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52618:97"/>kindly, but more or less sharply according to the occasion. In conversing with his Enemies, he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuk'd them for their Vices, detected and expos'd their Hypocrisie, and <hi>told them the Truth</hi> so plainly, that for that reason <hi>they sought to kill him.</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52618:97"/>to imitate him, were Truths necessary to be known by them, but hard to be receiv'd; therefore he often gave them hints thereof, without insisting long at a time upon them, making them still more sensible of them, as the time drew near. He tells them, that he had forborn to say divers things to them <hi>from the beginning, because he was with them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 16.4,</note> which yet he thought fit to impart before he left them; he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to them <hi>in Parables,</hi> what they could not bear in express terms.
<note place="margin">ver. 25,</note> At the very last he referr'd some things to the Revelation of the Spirit, after his Resurrection, because <hi>they could not bear them then,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 12, 13.</note> And for the same reason he did not put them upon some Exercises, that of <hi>fasting</hi> in particular,

                  <p>But more especially the great Prudence of our Saviour's Life was evidenc'd, by his managing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in such manner, as that notwithstanding all the Craft and Malice of his Enemies, he did not fall into their hands, till he had <hi>finish'd the work which God had given him to do.</hi> To which purpose, when at any time he perceiv'd their designs against him, he immediately withdrew to some other place, and thereby escap'd, of which the Evangelists give us many instances. Nay, when sometimes they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd more favourably inclin'd towards him, yet <hi>he did not commit himself to them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 2.23, 24.</note> because <hi>he knew what was in them.</hi> Upon the same account, he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forbad those whom he had Cur'd,

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52618:98"/>of all sorts came to tempt him, by putting captious Questions to him,
<note place="margin">Mat. 22.15, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                     </note> he gave them such An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, as they could not possibly make any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of.

                  <p>IN my last <hi>Lecture</hi> upon these Words, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to shew the Credibility of this <hi>Saying</hi> recommended by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> from the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that <hi>Pattern,</hi> which the Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution proposeth to us, in the Life of our blessed Saviour, this being one Part of that Method, in which <hi>Christ Jesus saveth Sinners, Viz.</hi> That he did not only instruct us in the Particulars of our Duty by his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but moreover hath left us an <hi>Example</hi> for our Imitation.</p>
                  <p>In treating on this Argument, I observed,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That the very Manner of our Saviour's Appearing and Dwelling upon Earth, the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condition and Circumstances of his Life, whilst he sojourned amongst us, were very instructive and examplary to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Manner of our Saviour's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor in these Circumstances, his Moral Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Actions, did in an especial manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie to us those Virtues which we are concern'd to imitate. Under this Head, I observ'd,</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52618:102"/>
                  <p>That the Life of our Saviour was truly Humane,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> every way suited to the Condition of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it was of God's Creation, and consequently fit to be proposed to us as our <hi>Pattern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it was a Life perfectly Innocent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it was Remarkable,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> for an unusual Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the greatest Simplicity and Integrity, with an exact Prudence. Thus far I have proceeded, and now go on to what remains, <hi>viz.</hi> to enumerate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse other Moral Qualifications, which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified to us in an Eminent and Conspicuous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the same Life, such as these following; a genuine and substantial Piety; a large and disinter ested Charity; a spotless Purity; a profound Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; an unparallel'd Meekness, Gentleness, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and lastly, a true and sedate Courage, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an unshaken Resolution and Constancy of Mind. The Consideration of each of these will be the Business of the present <hi>Lecture.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the Life of our blessed Saviour we have an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a genuine and substantial Piety, by which I mean a great Sense of, and Regard to Almighty God, testified by all such Expressions, as are suitable to the Nature of God, and the Relation between God and Man.</p>
                  <p>Thus for Instance,

                  </p>
                  <p>As he discovered a deep Sense of God upon his Mind, by such occasional Devotions, so he had also his Seasons of addressing himself to his Father in more solemn Manner, both publickly and privately.

                  <p>He always exprest a very great Regard to whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was any way related to God. His <hi>Word</hi> he ever mentioned with the highest Respect.
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.17, 18.</note>
                     <hi>Think not,</hi> says he, <hi>that I am come to destory the Law or the Prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till Heaven and Earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</hi> His Custom was to cite <hi>the Scriptures</hi> upon all Occasions, both for his own Direction and Support, and for the convincing and confuting his Adversaries; and the Application he made of them was always so apposite, so close, and so clear, that his Adversaries had nothing to reply, as might be made evident in abundance of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, he often exprest his Regard to <hi>the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 4.21.</note> as to <hi>God's House,</hi> and altho' he told the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that the Worship of God was not to be long confined to <hi>that,</hi> or any other particular Place, yet whilst it was employed by God's Appointment in his Service, he not only attended it constantly himself, but upon two several Occasions, exprest a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Zeal against the Prophaners of it,

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52618:103"/>to it. He attended at the several Festivals, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its Appointment; he eat the Passover with his Disciples; he observed the Sabbath, tho' not with a Pharisaical Superstition, yet according to the True Design of the Institution; he admonished those whom he healed of the Leprosie <hi>to offer the Gifts which</hi> Moses <hi>commanded.</hi> He attended at the Synagogue-Service,
<note place="margin">Matth. 8.4. Luke 5.14.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Direction of the Governours of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church, and the laudable Practice of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>He ever maintained a firm Faith and Trust in God, (one of the chief Instances of a Solid Piety, and the Root of all other Virtues.) Not to mention his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Works,
<note place="margin">Mat. 17.20. John 11.41, 42.</note> which were all wrought by Faith in the I ower of the Almighty; his whole Life, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end, was spent in a constant Dependence upon a special Providence, especially during the time of his Publick Ministry, when he went about doing the Work which was appointed him, and committing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self entirely to the Care of him who had sent him. It may seem too small an Instance to insist upon, <hi>that</hi> of his Unconcernedness in a Storm,
<note place="margin">Mat. 8.23.</note> when the Vessel he was in was <hi>covered with the Waves,</hi> and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples apprehended themselves in danger of <hi>perishing;</hi> seeing he reproves his Disciples, as having but <hi>little Faith</hi> upon that Occasion. We have indeed far higher Instances of his Faith in God, under much greater Trials, both when his Sufferings were approaching, and when he was actually under them. When his Disciples dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their unwillingness to go into <hi>Judea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 11.8, 9, 10.</note> as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Danger he would be exposed to there, he tells them what was the Principle upon which he acted; <hi>Are there not</hi> (says he) <hi>twelve Hours in the Day? If any Man walk in the Day, he stumbleth not, because he sees the Light of this World,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had said, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever dangers might threaten him, he could safely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52618:104"/>himself to the Divine Protection, which would certainly preserve him till he had finished his Work. In his Discourse with his Disciples, a little before he was apprehended, as he gives many Instances of his Faith, so particularly in those Words,
<note place="margin">Joh. 16 32.</note>
                     <hi>Behold, the Hour cometh, yea, is now come, when ye shall leave me alone: yet I am not alone; because the Father is with me.</hi> When his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies had seized him, and upon that occasion <hi>Peter</hi> drew his Sword, our Lord rebuked his irregular Zeal, by declaring his belief, that he could have obtained an Army of Angels to rescue him,
<note place="margin">Matth. 26.53, 54.</note> had it been a thing fit for him to ask, or for God to grant. When he hung upon the Cross, he comforted the Penitent Thief, by assuring him,
<note place="margin">Luk. 23.43.</note> that <hi>he should be that Day with him in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</hi> In the midst of his most grievous and pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Complaint, he still gave evidence of his Faith, by calling God <hi>his God</hi> twice in the same Breath;
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.46.</note> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after expir'd, with an Expression full of Trust in God,
<note place="margin">Luk 23 46.</note> saying, <hi>Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Virtue of this Faith, he always made the Glory of God his great End. He could truly profess to the Jews, that <hi>he sought not his own Glory;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This indeed is the true Way of glorifying God, by yielding, as our Saviour had done, a ready, a diligent, and a constant Obedience to his Will.
<note place="margin">Joh. 8.22.</note>
                     <hi>He always did those things, which pleased God,</hi> and this, not as we are apt to do, with Reluctancy; No, it was <hi>his Meat,</hi> the pleasure of his Life,

                     <hi>to do the Will of God, and to

<note place="margin">Luke 21.37, 38.</note>
                     <hi>In the Day time he was teaching in the Temple, whither the People came early in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to hear him,</hi> and he usually spent the whole Day, either in instructing the Minds, or healing the Bodies of Men.</p>
                  <p>Nor did he testifie his Piety only by Doing; but, which is yet more difficult, by submitting in all Cases to the VVill of his heavenly Father. His coming into the VVorld, his appearing in such mean Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, especially his suffering so many hard things both living and dying, were sufficient Evidences of an entire Resignation of his own VVill to the VVill of God. VVhen he spake of his approaching Sufferings, <hi>Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>is my Soul troubled, and what shall I say?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 12.27, 28.</note>
                     <hi>Father, save me from this Hour: But for this Cause came I to this Hour. Father, glorifie thy Name.</hi> How full of devout Submission was his Prayer in his Agony,
<note place="margin">Mar. 14.33, 34.</note> when his <hi>Soul</hi> was seized with <hi>amazement</hi> and <hi>anguish,</hi> when it was <hi>exceeding sorrowful, even unto Death,</hi> when the <hi>anguish</hi> of his Spirit caused him <hi>to sweat as it were great Drops of Blood falling down to the Ground,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 22.44.</note> when he had all the Sense of, and felt all the Reluctancy to his Sufferings, which innocent Humane Nature was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, <hi>falling on his face,</hi> and <hi>saying, O my father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note>
                     <hi>if it be possible, let this Cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> repeating <hi>the same Words a second,</hi> and a <hi>third time!</hi> The same resigned Temper he again testified to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he said,
<note place="margin">Joh. 18.11.</note>
                     <hi>The Cup which my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given me, shall I not drink it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereby all the Reluctancy of his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is justified, as perfectly innocent and blameless; since as it was no more than what was truly Natural and Humane, so it was accompanied with an entire Resignation to the Divine Will. For this is all that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52618:105"/>God doth or can require of a Creature, not to desire, not to be fond of Sufferings, nay, not to be insensible of them, or unaffected with them; but if it be his will to inflict them, willingly to submit to, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce in his disposal. 'Tis this indeed which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Submission a Virtue, that in exercising it, our wills are resigned to God's; and it was this, which exceedingly inhanced the Virtue of our Saviour's Submission, that he appears to have had so quick and tender a Sense both of his approaching and present Sufferings, and yet submitted. His Nature recoyled, but did not rebel. His Will, if it had been fit, would have chosen otherwise; but not being so, it yielded.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Head; Our Saviour's Piety appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in his making it his Business to excite the same Disposition in others. This was the Design of his Publick Preaching, and of his more private Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, to instruct Men in the Knowledge of God and his Will, and to perswade them to a suitable Practice; to which purpose he laid hold of every Oportunity and Occasion of discoursing to those that were with him,

                  <p>His Piety and Charity were in Truth so intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the very same Instances may be very often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for both, he having made, as we should do, his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52618:105"/>Love to Men the Effect and Proof of his Love to God, and the Acts of his Obedience being for the most part so many Instances of Beneficence also.</p>
                  <p>Charity was the Motive; and the Exercise of it, the great Design of his coming into the World. <hi>This is</hi> that <hi>faithful Saying,</hi> recorded in our Text, <hi>that Christ Jesus came into the World to save Sinners.</hi> And whilst he was in the World, his Business was,
<note place="margin">Acts 10.38.</note>
                     <hi>to go about doing good.</hi> It was his daily Employment, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Course of his Publick Ministry, to do good to the Souls and Bodies of Men. Thus the Evangelist tells us, <hi>Jesus went about all the Cities and Villages,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 9.35.</note>
                     <hi>teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every Sickness, and every Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease among the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He spent his time, as appears by the Account the Evangelists give us throughout their History, in instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Ignorant, reproving the Guilty, inviting Sinners to Repentance, encouraging the Penitent, and restoring Health and Strength to the Diseased and Infirm.</p>
                  <p>I mention the Cures he wrought, because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to represent the Life of our Saviour truly, without taking Notice of those Actions, which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up so considerable a part of his Life, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of his History, and which were indeed so notorious, as that the Jews themselves, together with the most Learned of the Ancient Infidels among the Pagans, such as <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Celsus,</hi> acknowledged them, tho' they did not own the Power by which he did them. However, I insist not now upon the miraculous Power by which he wrought his Cures; but only upon the Charity which he exercised therein, all the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which are ascribed to him, being also so many Instances of Kindness and Beneficence.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52618:106"/>
                  <p>Moreover, he did good, like his heavenly Father, to all sorts of Men, <hi>to the Evil and to the good.</hi> He did not despise or overlook any for their Poverty, or the Meanness of their Condition; nay, for their Ignorance, or their past Faults, if they were but willing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, and to amend for the future. He converst with the worst of Men; both those that were esteem'd so, and those that really were so, as a Physician with his Patients, in order to the curing their Spiritual Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases. He particularly encouraged repenting Sinners, declaring often,
<note place="margin">Luk 19.10</note> that <hi>he came to seek and to save that which was lost.</hi> He applied himself first indeed to <hi>the lost Sheep of the House of Israel:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 15.24.</note> But to shew that he did not intend to confine his Charity to the <hi>Jews</hi> only, he extended it to the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">verse 22. John 4.10, 40.</note> and to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also, as there was occasion offered.</p>
                  <p>He readily laid hold of every Oportunity of being kind and useful, nay, he sought Oportunities that he might be so. He kindly received those who came to him privately for Information;
<note place="margin">Joh 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> &amp;c</note> nor do we ever read, that he refused to give either Instruction or Relief to any one that seriously asked it of him. He did indeed at the first seem to deny the Woman of <hi>Canaan;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth 15.24, &amp;c.</note> but, as it appears, it was only to try her, and thereby to have an occasion of doing what was most grateful to him, commending and encouraging her Faith. When he was willing to retire,
<note place="margin">Luk. 9.10, 11, 12, 13.</note> yet if the People followed and prest upon him, his Compassion moved him to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them kindly, to teach, to heal, and to feed them.</p>
                  <p>Nay, he did not always stay till he was ask'd; but often prevented the miserable, and sav'd them the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of petitioning, by kindly offering his Assistance, whenever he beheld a compassionable Object. When he beheld a poor Man lying at the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5.6, 7.</note> infirm and helpless, knowing that he had laboured
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52618:106"/>under his Infirmity many Years, and had waited there a long time in vain, he asked him, <hi>Whether he would be made whole?</hi> and immediately restored his Strength to him; and again <hi>finding him</hi> a little after <hi>in the Temple,</hi> he made his first Kindness the Occasion of a second and a greater favour, admonishing him to improve the Blessing he had received: <hi>Behold!</hi> saith he,
<note place="margin">verse 14.</note>
                     <hi>thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</hi> His raising <hi>the Widow's Son,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 7.13,</note> was another Instance of the same kind, when his Goodness moved him to surprize the sorrowful Mother with an unexpected Favour.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Whatsoever good he did, he did it freely, having no other Reward but the Satisfaction of doing it. Nay, he persevered in doing good, in spight of all the many Provocations he met with to the contrary. He did, as his Gospel hath obliged his Disciples, Good for Evil. Even when his Enemies exercised the utmost of their Malice and Fury against him, he ceased not to pity and to pray for them. How pathetically did he express himself towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a little before his Suffering, declaring the desire he had, and the Pains he had taken to prevent its ruin! <hi>O Jerusalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23.37.</note>
                     <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem! How often would I have gathered thy Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not!</hi> Even when he was nailed to the Cross, and felt the worst that they could do to him, he made the best Apology for them,
<note place="margin">Luk. 23.34.</note> that Charity could invent, with his dying Breath recommending those that crucified him, to the Mercy of God. Nay, he died for them, who thus used him, as well as for the rest of Mankind, who had grievously offended both his Father and him. And <hi>herein was Love,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test that ever any other Man could be suppos'd to have for his very best <hi>Friend;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 15.13. Rom. 5.6, 8, 10.</note> but <hi>Jesus</hi> exercis'd it towards his <hi>Enemies,</hi> towards <hi>ungodly</hi> Men and <hi>Sinners,</hi> after
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52618:107"/>which I need not, nay, I cannot add any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to set forth the unbounded and disinterested Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Saviour. I proceed therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
                  <p>That spotless Purity,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> in which also our Lord made himself an Example to Men; by which I mean, that his Soul was not in the least defiled by dwelling in a Body of Flesh, nor corrupted by conversing with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and sensible Objects; but the reasonable and the divine Life prevail'd and triumph'd over the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal.</p>
                  <p>They were but few of the Pleasures of Sense which he vouchsafed to partake of, and those also very spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly. He was so wholly taken up with the Works of Piety and Charity above-mention'd, as to shew no other Regard for his Body, than what was absolutely necessary for the rendring it serviceable to his Mind, very often neglecting it, and denying it even its inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and lawful Refreshments, whilst he was busie in the Assairs of his great Employment.
<note place="margin">Mark 3.20. Joh. 4.6.7, 31, 32, 34.</note> He was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expos'd to hunger, and thirst, and weariness, whilst he went about preaching the Gospel, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring Help to the Needy. <hi>He had not</hi> sometimes <hi>leisure to cat his Bread,</hi> nor was he solicitous about it, <hi>having,</hi> as he told his Disciples, <hi>Meat to eat, which they knew not of.</hi> He refus'd not indeed, when invited, to be present at Entertainments, and sometimes accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Respect of being anointed with costly Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but in neither of these Instances was there any thing justly liable to censure. He always made the Entertainment an Oportunity, not only of obliging such as invited him, but moreover of discoursing piously and usefully to the Company there present, of which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52618:107"/>we have diverse remarkable Instances.
<note place="margin">Luk. 5.29. chap. 14.3, &amp;c. chap. 19.9, &amp;c.</note> In permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself to be anointed with a very costly Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which seems to have been upon two distinct Occasions, and by two several Persons) he allow'd in both Instances a Respect to be paid to him,
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.6. Joh. 12.3. Luke 7.37.</note> which was justly due, and very seasonably paid; and in one of them particularly an Occasion to be given for recording the Repentance and the Gratitudue of a reclaimed Sinner, as an Example and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to future Generations.</p>
                  <p>Our Lord did not indeed withdraw from the World, as I have already observ'd, that he might place himself out of the reach of sensible Objects, by which Men are so apt to be ensnared; nor did he, that we read of, use any unnatural and uncouth Methods for mortifying the Flesh, nor exercise any of those foolish Austerities, for which some fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Religionists have been famous; (all which in Truth looks either like a cowardly forsaking the Station which Providence hath assign'd us, in order to keep out of harms way, doing little or no good, in order to the doing no evil; or else like a vain Ambition to appear singular and extraordinary; or seems at the best but the result of Ignorance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition:) but he preserv'd himself innocent and pure, (as we ought to do) in Ways and Methods suitable to the Condition of Humane Nature, and the Design of this present Life, always keeping his Body in that perfect Subjection to his Spirit, that it might be a ready Instrument either in doing or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Will of God. And therefore, when by God's Will he was exposed not only to the more tolerable Inconveniencies and Hardships of Life, but to very grievous Sufferings also,
<note place="margin">Isa. 50.5, 6.</note>
                     <hi>he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52618:108"/>as the Prophet speaks in his Name, <hi>neither turned he away back: but gave his back to the Smiters, and his Cheeks to them that pluck'd off the Hair; he hid not his Face from shame and spitting.</hi> As he had subdued his Flesh before,
<note place="margin">1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>The next Instance I named,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> in which our blessed Saviour became an Example to us, was his profound Humility.</p>
                  <p>I have already observ'd, That his voluntary as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming our Nature, and submitting to all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances with which his Incarnation was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were Instances of a wonderful Condescension; as likewise that in the more private part of his Life, he was an eminent Pattern of Humility: and when he took upon him his Publick Employment, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the real Dignity of his Person, and the singular Nature of his Commission, yet his Temper and his Carriage were not alter'd. He took no worldly State upon him. He chose for his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Attendants, Men of the meanest Rank and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<note place="margin">John 6.15.</note> He ever declin'd the Offers of Secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Honor. When he once accepted the Respect and Applauses of the People, it was, as the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist observes,
<note place="margin">Matth. 21, 9, 16.</note> from <hi>the Multitudes,</hi> and as himself expresses it, <hi>out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings,</hi> and this too not till he knew that the time of his leaving this World drew near.
<note place="margin">John 8.49, 50.</note> He <hi>honour'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as he told the Jews, <hi>not seeking his own Glory;</hi> so far from that, that he liv'd in those Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52618:108"/>and continually did those things, which he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew would, though unreasonably, cause him to be despis'd by that evil Generation, sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his very Reputation to the Honour of God, and the Benefit of Mankind. When one call'd him,
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.17.</note>
                     <hi>good Master,</hi> he replied, that <hi>no one was good, but God;</hi> not thereby denying himself to be <hi>good,</hi> or that he was really <hi>God;</hi> but making this Reply to one that spake to him in the Style, which the Jews us'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Doctors, looking upon him as a meer Man, according to the Form, which he had taken upon him. He complied, as I took Notice before, with Institutions which he had no need of, that he might be an Example to others. He condescended to converse with the meanest, and the worst of Men, that he might be useful to them. He made a general and an earnest Invitation to Sinners,
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.28, 29.</note> to come to him, if they were but touch'd with a Sense of their Sins, and were desirous to be deliver'd from the Burden of them, assuring them for their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that he was <hi>lowly in Heart.</hi> His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples <hi>marvelled,</hi> when they saw him talking with <hi>the Woman of Samaria,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 4.27.</note> which he readily condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do for her Instruction.
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.13. <hi>ch.</hi> 18.2, &amp;c.</note> He took great No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as I have observ'd, of the <hi>young Children</hi> which were presented to him, and testified an especial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to all such as should be found like to them, in simplicity and humility of Temper, however little and inconsiderable they might appear in the Eyes of the World. He declar'd,
<note place="margin">Mat. 12.48.</note> that <hi>whosoever should do the Will of his heavenly Father,</hi> without any regard to his Quality or Circumstances in the World, was to him as his <hi>his Brother, his Sister, and his Mother.</hi>

                  <p>'Tis true, he did sometimes take another Course with these Men, accusing and upbraiding them in a very severe manner, telling them they were <hi>Hypocrites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23.13, 17, 33. Mat. 12.39. Joh. 8.44.</note>

But if the Matter be throughly considered, this admits of a very fair Account, and such as is altogether consistent with what I have said upon this Head.</p>
                  <p>Supposing the Scribes and Pharisees to have been of such a Temper as the History of the Evangelists represents them (of which there can be no reason to doubt) there's nothing said of them by our Saviour, but what was strictly true. Malice and Hypocrisie mixt together make the very worst Constitution, that humane Nature is capable of, which cannot be better represented, than by resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling it to that of venemous Creatures, or accursed Spirits, and is in truth so exquisitely bad, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any thing bad enough can be said of it. 'Tis true, after all this, it might not have become every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man to have told them the truth so openly, and so plainly; and that partly for want of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge of the inward Temper and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of others; and partly for want of a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Authority to rebuke all sorts of Sinners with freedom: but our blessed Saviour, who, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, thorowly knew the Hearts of Men, and was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52618:110"/>come into the World with a special and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Commission from God, might well be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, to tell them their own, in the plainest Terms. <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, by Virtue of a Divine Commission, did the like;
<note place="margin">Matth. 3 7.</note> and much more might He, whom St. <hi>John</hi> acknowledged to be so much <hi>Greater</hi> than himself, do it. Especially if we add, That he had taken the gentler Course first, mildly arguing with them, with Great Strength of Reason, as I have already obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Particular; Our Saviour's Meekness was then most Conspicuous, when he met with the utmost personal Provocations: When one of his own Disciples vilely betray'd him, upon his approaching to give him the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Kiss, he said no more, but <hi>Friend,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26.50. Luke 22.48, 52, 53.</note>
                     <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou come?</hi> And again, <hi>Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a Kiss?</hi> To <hi>the Chief Priests, and Captains, and Elders,</hi> that came with <hi>Judas,</hi> he address'd himself in this mild Language, <hi>Be ye come out as against a Thief, with Swords and Staves? When I was daily with you in the Temple, ye stretched forth no Hands against me: but this is your Hour, and the Power of Darkness.</hi> Not one passionate or indecent Expression in all this; nor when he was presently after brought upon his Tryal; nor under his Sufferings themselves. But that leads me to another Instance, nearly allyed to this of Meekness, <hi>Viz.</hi>

                  <p>That he quietly underwent many Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies and Hardships, through the Course of a mean and poor Life, may be rather call'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedness than Patience; that he bore with the Weakness of his Friends; and the perverseness of his Enemies, during the space of his Publick Ministry, may be properly reduc'd to the last Head of Meekness; but his Patience appear'd in his quietly susteining those severe Sufferings which befel him, both immediately before, and at his Crucisixion, during all which time, it is observable, that not one froward or impatient word proceeded out of his Mouth. When he stood before the Council, and they laid many grievous things to his Charge, which he knew to be false,

                  <p>And that which render'd this Patience of our Lord still the more considerable was, that he was all this while conscious of Perfect Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and very sensible of the Injury done him by those who inflicted these Sufferings upon him.

<note place="margin">Matth. 4.1, &amp;c.</note> when he assaulted him by several different Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, at his setting out upon his great Work; which to those who are his Disciples, is a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to instruct and encourage them, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the Attempts of their Spiritual and Invisible Enemy: But I rather chuse to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Constancy in resisting and overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Temptations he met with from Men, of which we have many Instances, which cannot be denyed by our Adversaries themselves.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose 'tis observable, that he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affected with the Applauses, nor imposed upon by the Pretences, nor discouraged by the Reproaches and Threatnings of those he had to do with.

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52618:114"/>
                  <p>And as the certain and near Prospect of his Sufferings could not discourage him from thus go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, to meet and face them; so neither did the feeling of them, when they were the most sharp and severe, weaken his Resolution, or break the firmness of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that both in his Agony in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (as I before observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d) and likewise whilst he was upon the Cross, he discover'd a very quick Sense of his Sufferings, and such as some of the Adversaries of Christianity have urged as a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Argument, that our Saviour wanted that Courage and Firmness of Spirit, which I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to him. But in this they betray as much Ignorance as Malice, and plainly shew that they not only are destitute of a Spiritual and Divine Sense, but that they want also a just Idea of the Frame of Humane Nature.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Virtue</hi> of <hi>Courage</hi> cannot consist in the Strength and Vigor of the Animal Spirits; nor in an obstinate Resolution not to complain, or seem at all sensible of Sufferings. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the most excellent Constitution, particularly to the Purposes of Virtue and Piety, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly that which is most tender and sensible; and such a Constitution we may therefore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably presume our Saviour's to have been, which as it would necessarily occasion a very quick Sense both of the Pain and the Ignominy he was exposed to, so there was in his Case also a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52618:115"/>of many other Circumstances, whereby this Sense would be heighten'd. He, whom we Christians believe to have been the Son of God, and to have suffered for the Sins of Men, in order to the making Expiation for them, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily have had a deep Sense of the Displeasure of his heavenly Father, on Account of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy of Mankind; as also of the heinous Evil of Sin, and all the Misery to which it had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, the Children of Men. He must have been farther strongly affected with the disingenuity and baseness of those Men by whom he was thus vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cruelly treated, and from thence conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Difficulty of recovering Sinners to God, and the Misery to which a great Part of Mankind would through their own Perverseness still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves, notwithstanding all he did and suffered for them. He was wise and good enough, possess'd with such an ardent Love both to God and Man, as to be deeply touch'd with these and many other such like Apprehensions, which may not perhaps duly affect us, through our Ignorance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerateness and narrowness of Spirit. And after all, he might be left by God to feel as much from all these Circumstances concurring, as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Humane Nature is capable of feeling, that by this Means his Sufferings might be so much the more considerable and valuabe, to the Ends for which they were designed. And I doubt not, but whosoever has good Nature and Religion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be in any measure touch'd with these Considerations, will readily acknowledge, that as our Saviour's Sufferings were much greater than
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52618:115"/>those of any other Man upon Earth, so his Sense of them was very well consistent with True Courage and Firmness of Spirit; since notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their aggravating Circumstances, he persisted to the last in a submissive Resignation of himself to the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Particular; As from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Sufferings to the end, he utter'd nothing unbecoming his Character, so whilst he hung upon the Cross, and his Pain and Grief must be supposed most exquisite, he said diverse things, which shewed both the Clearness of his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the firmness of his Mind at that time. He exprest a tender Regard to his Mother, the blessed Virgin,
<note place="margin">Joh. 19.25. Luk. 23 34, 42. Joh. 19 28, 29, 30.</note> committing her to the Care of his beloved Disciple; he kindly apologized and pray'd for his Enemies; he comforted the Penitent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor; and when he knew that all things were accomplished, saving one Prophecy, of their <hi>giving him Vinegar to drink,</hi> he gave an Occasion for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and when he had received it, he declared, that <hi>it was finished,</hi> and <hi>commending his Spirit to his heavenly Father, he bowed his Head, and gave up the Ghost,</hi> remaining thus constant and unalterable to the last, and conquering even by dying.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have gone through what I proposed, briefly pointing at several Instances, in which our blessed Saviour hath given us an <hi>Example,</hi> and of which the Evangelists have given us a more full and particular Narrative; whose Writings upon this Account deserve our most serious and impartial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual, as describing to us, in a plain, simple, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected Style, a Life to which there is nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52618:116"/>in the most learned and renowned Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; a Life which none but <hi>the Son of God</hi> could have lived, and which none but those who conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with him, or were endued in some measure with his Spirit, could have written, as the Evangelists have done. Had our Saviour been no greater a Person, than the Adversaries of Christianity sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him; and had the Evangelists been furnish'd with no greater Abilities than their Education had given them, we could not possibly have had from them, such fair Characters of True Goodness, of Solid Piety and Virtue of all Kinds, without the least Defect or Mixture, as we read in the Gospels.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude this Discourse with admonishing my self, and all that hear me, of the mighty Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation this Example lays upon all the professed Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Jesus.</hi> It is the Example of him whom we call <hi>our Lord and Master,</hi> who took our Nature upon him, that he might not only teach, but shew us how to live, and who hath engaged us in the highest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by living and dying for our sakes 'Tis, in a word, the Example of <hi>God,</hi> when he became <hi>Man,</hi> that he might restore us to the Image and the Favour of God.</p>
                  <p>Then, and then only shall we represent him truly to the World, when we become like to him in our Tempers and our Practices; by this Means we may hope to convince Unbelievers, and to procure that Esteem and Honour to the Name of our Lord, which is due from all Mankind.</p>

                        <p>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the World, to save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.—</p>

                  <p>IN discoursing of the Method, in which the great <hi>Mediator between God and Man, Christ Jesus,</hi> hath undertaken <hi>to save Sinners,</hi> I propos'd to consider the <hi>Necessities</hi> of fallen Men, and thereby to evince both that we had very great need of the assistance of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and that no Method, which we can possibly think of, could have so fully answer'd the end of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for our <hi>Necessities,</hi> as that which our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, by his <hi>coming into the World</hi> hath been pleas'd to take.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Necessities</hi> of Men I reduc'd to <hi>four</hi> Heads.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> A suspicion and jealousy of Mind concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and an Alienation from him, as consequent thereupon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> A gross ignorance of God, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and of the several particulars of their Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An indisposition and inability to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Divine Will, although it should be fully and clearly reveal'd.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52618:118"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> After all, an incapacity of removing those other evil and mischievous Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to which their sins had expos'd them, and of obtaining for themselves that compleat Salvation, which they stood in need of.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>two</hi> former of these I have consider'd at large, and now proceed to those <hi>two</hi> which remain, which I shall treat of with greater Brevity, what I have to offer upon these Heads, not requiring so much inlargment, as on the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> therefore, The next Difficulty which fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Men are under, is this, That they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves indispos'd and unable to comply with the Divine Will, even when it is fully and clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever will impartially consider what I have offer'd, touching the <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> of our Blessed Saviour, and will seriously study the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the New Testament, in which a particular account of each of them is contain'd, must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that a profess'd Christian cannot want sufficient <hi>Instruction,</hi> in all the particulars of his Duty: But there is still something farther necessary, <hi>viz.</hi> to be both <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to comply with the <hi>Precepts,</hi> and to imitate the <hi>Example</hi> thus set before him. Christians themselves confess, and complain with the Apostle,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52618:118"/>that the <hi>Precepts</hi> of our Lord are too strict, and his <hi>Example</hi> too exact, to be complyed with and imitated by humane Nature. And this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the Reason, why so many profess'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians act disagreeably to their Profession, <hi>viz.</hi> That their Appetites and Passions are too strong for their Understanding and Reason: they know the Will of God, and inwardly approve it, but cannot prevail with themselves to obey it: <hi>to Will,</hi> that is to have some faint and imperfect inclination to act according to the conviction of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>is present with them;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 18, 19.</note> but how <hi>to perform that which is good, they find not:</hi> So that <hi>the good which they would, they do not; but the evil which they would not, that they do,</hi> as the same Apostle emphatically expresses it. And all this is but one of those evil Consequences, which, as I observed in a former Lecture,
<note place="margin">Lect. ij. p. 20, 21.</note> naturally follow our apostacy from God.</p>
                  <p>My present Business therefore is to shew, what Provision our <hi>Mediator</hi> hath made in this case; and this I shall do, in the <hi>three</hi> following Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Our Blessed Saviour hath provided in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by annexing such Sanctions to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as do naturally tend most powerfully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our Minds.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. By promising the assistance of the Divine Spirit, for the enabling us to do what of our selves we cannot.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. By settling such institutions to be constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observ'd and us'd in his Church, as are both in their own Nature proper to excite us, and are moreover design'd as Means of conveying the Grace. of the Holy Spirit to us.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52618:119"/>
                  <p n="1">I. By annexing such Sanctions to his Precepts, as do naturally tend most powerfully to influence our Minds.</p>
                  <p>The Precepts of Christianity are all of them so perfectly good in their own Nature, and so tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly agreeable to the Understanding of a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature, that every Man to whom they are made known, would readily comply with them, if it were not for the seeming Pleasures of Sin, and the difficulties with which some instances of Virtue seem to be attended; <hi>seem,</hi> I say; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, the Experience of every good Christian fully satisfies him, that the present Pleasure, which attends a faithful compliance with the Precepts of the Gospel, greatly preponderates all its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; as the uneasiness and the remorse, which attend a sinful Course of Life, do on the other hand render its Pleasures very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.
<note place="margin">Prov. 3.17.</note>
                     <hi>The ways of Wisdom are ways of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness, and all her Paths are Peace;</hi> and to him that is become a thorow Christian, <hi>the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are not Grievous.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 5.3.</note> But nevertheless, thus it falls out, through the Error and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind, that Men are frequently misled by a present Pleasure, which they feel in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their sensual inclinations; and that the practice of Christian Piety and Virtue, forasmuch as it thwarts such inclinations, becomes difficult and irksome to them. Now to balance this, our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour hath by his Gospel propos'd, over and above the present satisfaction and Pleasure which are to be found in compliance with his Laws, future rewards for our Obedience, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Punishments for our Disobedience.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52618:119"/>
                  <p>The Passions of Hope and Fear were implanted in our Nature by him who made us, to be a check upon our present Sense; and they are of especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Use to us, during this state of our Tryal, to preserve us from being influenc'd by the false and deceitful appearances of present and sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And although we cannot be said to have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at a Christian Frame and Constitution of Spirit, till we heartily approve the Precepts of our Religion, and chuse to comply with them, on account of their own intrinsick reasonableness and goodness; yet 'tis usually by the hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the fear of Punishments, that our Minds are at first awaken'd, and our thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come duly fix'd; and even after we have attain'd to a sincere and prevalent love of Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue upon their own account, yet still our nopes and fears are of great use to us, to excite our Minds, to quicken our Endeavours, and to turn the Scale, upon all Emergencies, against the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Sense.</p>
                  <p>And by how much the more considerable the Objects of our hope and fear are, by so much the greater is the influence which they will have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. For which reason, the Gospel hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to us <hi>such</hi> Rewards and Punishments in the life to come, as to those who thoroughly believe and consider them, will appear infinitely to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh all the present Pleasures by which foolish Sinners are courted, and the present difficulties by which they are apt to be discouraged. For it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth on the one hand, all that Happiness, which humane Nature compleated by the union of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Soul with an incorruptible Body, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52618:120"/>to the favor of Almighty God, is capable of; and on the other hand, it threatens all that Misery, that Men compos'd of Soul and Body reunited, but unregenerated, and abandon'd by God, are obnoxious to; the particulars of which states are indeed such as we, cannot have a full conception of in this Life; but from the general view which the Gospel hath given us, both of the <hi>Quality,</hi> and the <hi>Duration</hi> of this future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Misery, we have all the reason in the World to infer, that nothing, but either down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right disbelief of these things, or the want of representing them duly to our Minds, by frequent and serious consideration, can render them inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to excite our hope and fear to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as will serve to influence our tempers and our lives.</p>
                  <p>For the farther promoting of which ends, the Gospel hath fully and clearly asserted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and Certainty of these future Recompences, not speaking of them, as of what may <hi>possibly</hi> be, or what is only <hi>probable;</hi> but as of what we may as surely depend upon, as upon any other Truths which it hath reveal'd to us, leaving no room for any profess'd Christian to doubt or hesitate concerning them.</p>
                  <p>And herein it must be granted, that the Method taken by the Christian Institution, for exciting our hope and fear, and by consequence for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us effectually to comply with its Precepts, altogether surpasses what has been done by any other institution of Religion. It would be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to compare the dreams of Pagan Poets, or the Mahometan Fables, concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52618:120"/>and Punishments of the life to come, with the Promises and Threatnings of the Gospel. As to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Institution, which we Christians acknowledge to have been Divine, it look'd no farther in its Promises and Threatnings, at least not in plain and express terms, than to the good and evil things of the present life. Not but that wise and good Men amongst the Jews, looking beyond the Letter of their Law, did see, tho' obscurely, into the other World.</p>
                  <p>The notion of the Soul's Immortality was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from Nature and Reason, generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd by the considering part of Mankind: but yet the wisest and best Philosophers express'd themselves very dubiously with respect to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, of which sufficient Evidence might be produc'd both from <hi>Socrates</hi> amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> who seem to have gone as far as any others in the Expectation and Hope of Immortality; but yet could not say enough powerfully to excite the hopes of good Men, or the fears of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to such a degree, as might suffice to balance the Temptations of the present Life, at least with the vulgar and unthinking part of Men, which is by far the greater number. Whereas the Gospel speaks so plainly, and so positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of these matters, as may be sufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence all sorts of Men by whom it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Particular; The belief of the Recompences of the Life to come, as reveal'd by the Gospel, is that which has made so wide a difference between the Christian and the Pagan
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52618:121"/>World. What the State of the Heathen was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publishing of Christianity, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in a former Lecture.
<note place="margin">Lect. ij. p. 23.</note> Men were almost universally and totally fallen from the <hi>Divine,</hi> and sunk into the <hi>Animal</hi> Life, estranged from God, and enslav'd by the Devil and their own Lusts: But when the Gospel was Published, it awaken'd their Minds, causing them to look sorward towards another Life, and to consider the consequences of their present behaviour.</p>
                  <p>There are indeed in this degenerate State of the Christian Church, abundance of Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing themselves Christians, who are yet as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reform'd as the worst of Infidels: But then, 'tis because they do not heartily believe, or at least do not at all consider the Principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. But as this is certain, that where Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity is Profess'd, there are far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of all Ranks of Men, who are persuaded to the practice of Piety and Virtue, than there are in other parts of the World; so 'tis as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this is in great measure owing to the Principles which I am now speaking of. 'Tis the belief of a future Life, which keeps bad Men in the Christian World, from being much worse than they are: 'Tis that which first awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and excited most of those, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from an evil Course: And 'tis that, which those who are become Christians in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, hearty lovers of Piety and Virtue, are forc'd often to have recourse to, seriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting to their own Minds, those future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenses which the Gospel assures them of, in order to the strengthening their good Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52618:121"/>and the fortifying themselves against the many Temptations they meet with in this evil World. By all which, we may perceive the great Usefulness, and even Necessity of these Motives, which the Gospel hath offer'd to our Consideration. But this is not all; for</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Our Blessed Saviour hath made farther Provision against the Indisposition and Inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Men, by promising the assistance of the Divine Spirit, for the enabling us to do what of our selves we cannot.</p>
                  <p>Every created and finite Spirit must be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed necessarily and constantly to depend upon that Spirit which is uncreated and infinite, ever standing in need of Influences from him. A state of Innocency and Integrity cannot exempt a Creature from such dependance. This,
<note place="margin">Lect. ij. p. 27, 28.</note> as I have formerly observ'd, results from the Nature and Condition of a Creature, to be of it self muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fallible, insomuch that it can by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means preserve its Integrity, than by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to its Maker, and deriving Influences from him. Much more then, upon the degeneracy of such a Creature, some special influence from God must be necessary in order to its Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                  <p>It was, as I have taken Notice,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> from neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to adhere to God and depend upon him, that our first Parents apostatiz'd, whereby they and their Off-spring became, not mutable and fallible; <hi>that</hi> they were before; but, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience too plainly proves, very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52618:122"/>and weaken'd in all their Faculties, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving contracted an Indisposition to that which is Good, together with strong Habits of Sin. The Spirit, having once given way to the Flesh, lost its Authority and Government, which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily reassume.</p>
                  <p>In order therefore to a recovery from this state, to effect which is the great design of Christianity, there must be a supply of new strength, some extraordinary influences from the Divine Spirit, to reduce the Soul into good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to preserve it, when so reduc'd. And for this we are beholden to the Undertaking of our great <hi>Mediator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, good Men in all Ages of the World, such I mean as have had a becoming sense of God, and of natural Religion, have profess'd their reliance upon God, and there hopes of his assistance; and I question not, but they have in some measure partaken of what they thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for; which was in truth, though not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood by them, the effect of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace through Jesus Christ; whose Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, as we Christians believe, had its effect for the benefit of Mankind, ever since the first Promise made to <hi>Adam</hi> after his Fall. But, as the greater part of Man were left to the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of Nature, and the conjectures of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in this case, having no express Declaration or Promise, which they knew of, upon which they might depend; so the Pious and good Men amongst the Jews themselves, who enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Divine Oracles, yet believ'd and hop'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52618:122"/>for the assistance of the Divine Spirit, rather upon the grounds of natural Religion, than of their own Law, the Promises of which, as I before observ'd, were chiefly of the good things of this life, what was beyond this being rather obscurely hinted to them, than plainly express'd. For which reason St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the Jewish Law, and was thoroughly acquainted with the sense in which his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen generally understood it, says,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7, 8.</note> That <hi>sin taking occasion by the Commandment, wrought all manner of Concupiscence;</hi> and again,
<note place="margin">10.</note>That <hi>the Commandment, which was ordain'd unto Life, was found to be unto Death;</hi> and again, That <hi>the Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ch. 8.3, 4.</note>
                     <hi>in that it was weak through the Flesh, could not</hi> effect that <hi>Righteousness in us,</hi> which it aimed at. By all which he plainly asserts, that the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as such, only declared Mens Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but brought no assistance along with it to enable them to perform it; and consequently, left them in a worse state, than it found them, without the addition of Gospel Grace.</p>
                  <p>The Prophets indeed utter'd many Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a plentiful Effusion of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
<note place="margin">Is. 44.3. Ezek. 36.26, 27. Joel 2.28.</note> But this was to be in the Days of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as the Jews did, and we Christians now do understand those Prophecies to import. And they were accordingly fulfilled in the days of our Blessed Saviour; there having been a very plentiful Effusion of the Divine Spirit upon the Apostles, and first Preachers, and Professors of Christianity, to enable them to do extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Works, and to capacitate them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52618:123"/>and undergo their Employments and their Sufferings: And not only so, but we have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, both from our Lord and his Apostles, express and clear Promises of the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same Spirit, to enlighten and assist the Minds of Christians in every succeeding Age.</p>
                  <p>Our Lord to this purpose did in general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the readiness of Almighty God, <hi>to give his Holy Spirit</hi> to all those who should <hi>ask it of him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 11.13.</note> arguing from the goodness of God, and his fatherly care of Men, infinitely exceeding that of any earthly Parent.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, our Lord hath given a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Divine Spirit, to all such as shall come to him, and believe in him. At a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Festival of the Jews,
<note place="margin">John 7.37, 38, 39.</note>
                     <hi>Jesus stood and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, saying, If any Man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, Out of his belly shall flow Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of living Water.</hi> And <hi>this,</hi> as the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists adds, <hi>He spake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: For the Holy Ghost was not yet given,</hi> (not in that plentiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as afterwards,) <hi>because that Jesus was not yet Glorified.</hi> And indeed it was after the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of <hi>Jesus,</hi> that this Spirit was given, first in so wonderful a manner, as on the day of Pentecost, as a pledge of his being thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward to direct and assist the Church of Christ in all succeeding Ages, a Promise to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose being given to all the Members of the Christian Body. For so St. <hi>Peter,</hi> discoursing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52618:123"/>to the Jews upon that occasion,
<note place="margin">Acts 2.38, 39.</note> solemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares. <hi>Repent,</hi> says he, <hi>and be Baptiz'd every one of you, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of Sins; and ye shall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost. For the Promise is unto you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the Lord our God shall call.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis upon this account, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares so amply the Power which Christians receiv'd by the Gospel, to enable them to do what, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Abilities of Nature, nor by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> they could have done. When, in the place before-cited, he had complain'd of <hi>the Law in the Members</hi> whereby Men are <hi>Captivated,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.23, 24.</note> and thereupon express'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pathetically his Sense of the <hi>Wretchedness</hi> of Men, by reason of <hi>the Body of Death</hi> which they carry about with them, he concludes with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in the Grace of the Gospel,
<note place="margin">v. 25.</note>
                     <hi>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord;</hi> farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining himself in the following Words;
<note place="margin">ch. 8.1, 2, 3, 4.</note>
                     <hi>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit. For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death. For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful Flesh, and</hi> as a Sacrifice <hi>for Sin, condemned Sin in the Flesh; that the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit;</hi> as much as to say, that by embracing the Gospel of Christ, he was not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52618:124"/>only freed from <hi>Condemnation,</hi> on account either of his past Faults, or his present unavoidable Infirmities; but moreover received strength through the assistance of the Spirit of Christ, which would enable him sincerely, though not without all imperfection, to obey the Laws of God, and to attain to that <hi>Righteousness,</hi> which through the inordinacy of the Flesh, and the weakness of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Institution, he could not attain to before.</p>
                  <p>For the same reason elsewhere comparing the Law with the Gospel, he gives the preference to the latter, in very significant terms. The <hi>Law</hi> he stiles <hi>the Ministration of the Letter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.3, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>
                     <hi>which killeth;</hi> the <hi>Gospel, the Ministration of the Spirit, which giveth Life:</hi> One, <hi>the Ministration of Death,</hi> and <hi>of Condemnation, written and engraven in Stone;</hi> the other, <hi>the Ministration of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, written in fleshly Tables of the Heart, with the Spirit of the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 'tis needless to recite more Passages, the New Testament is full of them; this being the great Promise of the Gospel, declar'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sacred Writings, that the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit should be imparted in a free and plentiful manner to those, who should embrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion.</p>
                  <p>And this certainly is a sufficient Provision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the indisposition and inability of Men's Minds to comply with the Divine Will, when reveal'd to them.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52618:124"/>
                     <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and Divine; whereas we are <hi>Carnal and sold under Sin:</hi> But the Spirit of God can rescue us from this Slavery, by enlightning our Minds, fixing our Thoughts, inclining our Hearts, and spiritualizing our Affections, making us not only <hi>to delight in the Law of God after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Man;</hi> but <hi>to walk</hi> also <hi>not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi> The Example of our Lord was exact, and altogether perfect, and we must not hope in this life to attain to the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness and perfection: But as it was upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its Perfection fit to be propos'd to our imitation; so the same Spirit which dwelt in our Lord, without measure, can form us by degrees after his likeness, and make us in our measure to resemble him both in our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Practices.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, that we want instances amongst the Professors of Christianity, to verify this Doctrine, that the Divine Spirit is thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted by the Gospel; the Answer is easy. The primitive times of Christianity abounded with instances of this kind. Such were the Apostles, who could every one of them have said, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Be ye followers of me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.1.</note>
                     <hi>even as I also am of Christ.</hi> And such were abundance of the Members of the Christian Body, which liv'd in and near those times. Nay such, thanks be to God, even since the degeneracy of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, there have been and are to be met with in every Age; though, God knows, too few, to the great scandal of Unbelievers, who are not willing to consider this matter tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52618:125"/>but are forward to catch at any seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantage, for justifying their Infidelity. In a word, we might all of us be instances of this kind, to the honour of our Lord, and to the credit of our Holy Profession, if we would diligently use the means appointed for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this Divine Spirit, and faithfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all his kindly motions upon our Minds; which brings me to the next particular I nam'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. That our Blessed Saviour hath made far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provision in this Case, by settling such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions to be constantly observ'd and us'd in his Church, as are both in their own Nature proper to excite us, and are moreover design'd as Means of conveying the Grace of the Holy Spirit to us.</p>
                  <p>The excellency of the <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> of our Lord will not engage us to Obedience and Imitation, unless we have them much in our view: The powerful <hi>Motives</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel will not affect us, unless they be seriously and frequently consider'd by us: And the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Divine Spirit it self, though freely offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet will prove ineffectual, unless it be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and carefully entertain'd and improv'd. Now as the indisposition of Mens minds is great, so experience teacheth, that either the Business, or the Pleasures of Life are moreover apt to employ or divert them to that degree, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less some farther course be taken to turn the Stream of their Thoughts the right way, all that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52618:125"/>we have hitherto mention'd may be lost upon them. Besides that the Spirit of God being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, and his influences, suitable to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, secret and indiscernible to sensual and worldly Men (which is the reason our Saviour assigns, why <hi>the World cannot receive him,</hi> viz.
<note place="margin">John 14.17.</note>
                     <hi>because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him;</hi>) it may therefore be very fit, nay necessary for us, who are us'd so much to converse with sensible Objects, to have some stated, external, and sensible Means, for the deriving his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grace to our Spirits. Our blessed Saviour therefore knowing this to be our Case, hath kindly and bountifully provided for us in this instance also.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose, he hath not only caus'd his Word to be Written by those who Conversed with him, and were Commission'd and Inspir'd by him, which we may at all times have free recourse to our selves; but he hath farthermore appointed certain Institutions, to be constantly observ'd in his Church, and settled an Order of Men as his Ministers, to see them observ'd, and to perform their part in the observance of them. Thus he order'd the Apostles and their Successors in the work of the Ministry, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into the number of his Disciples, all such as should profess their Repentance and Faith in him, by the external Rite of washing them with Water, in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, thereby listing and enrolling them, as Servants of the Blessed Trinity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them by a solemn and publick Profession to declare themselves such.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52618:126"/>
                  <p>He hath farther ordain'd, That all his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, thus initiated, shall not only perform acts of Christian Devotion by themselves, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that they shall frequently meet together, to joyn in the more publick Worship of God through Jesus Christ, and mutually to exhort and encourage each other; particularly, that on a certain Day, every Week, besides other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Assemblies, they shall meet in most solemn manner, to offer up the sacrifice of Praise and Prayer to the great Father of all, in the Name of his only begotten Son; and that at the same time his Word shall be Read and Preach'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, in order to the improving their Understandings, and the awakening their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and the causing them to remember and consider the great Truths which they profess to believe.</p>
                  <p>He hath farther appointed, That in these so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Assemblies, they shall frequently comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate the great Sacrifice which he made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the Cross, by partaking of that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment which he hath assign'd them at his own Table, thereby not only professing themselves all Members of the same Body, but at the same time also representing to God, to themselves, and to one another, the infinite love of God to Sinners, through a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and solemnly engaging themselves afresh to continue the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Now these Institutions, howsoever they may be despised by the prophane, unthinking, or supercilious sort of Infidels, whosoever seriously
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52618:126"/>considers them, cannot but see, that they have a natural and strong tendency to engage the Thoughts, and awaken the Minds of those that use them, and thereby to render both the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> and the <hi>Example,</hi> and the <hi>Motives</hi> of the Gospel useful to the ends for which they were design'd.</p>
                  <p>And if we will yet farther look into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of them, we shall find, that they are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over appointed by our Lord, as means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving and conveying the Grace of his Holy Spirit to our Souls.</p>
                  <p>Thus, when our Lord commission'd his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <hi>to make Disciples out of all Nations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 28.19, 20.</note>
                     <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them, and teaching them to observe all things whatsoever he had commanded them,</hi> he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately subjoyns, <hi>And lo, I am with you always, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the end of the World;</hi> which can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no less, than his assisting and blessing them and their Successors, in the faithful discharge of their Ministry. He else-where declares in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<note place="margin">Matth. 18.20.</note> that <hi>where two or three are gathered together in his Name, there is he in the midst of them, viz.</hi> by the presence and assistance of his Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>As to the Sacrament of Baptism, St. <hi>Peter</hi> is very express, in the place before cited, where exhorting his Hearers to <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>be Baptized,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2.38, 39.</note> he encourages them by proposing the Benefits which they should receive thereby, namely, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins,</hi> and <hi>the Gift of the Holy Ghost, the promise</hi> of which, he says, was not to that Generation only, but <hi>to their Children, and to all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52618:127"/>that were afar off, even as many as God should call.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 3.5.</note> For which reason our Saviour himself, in his discourse with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> joyn'd together <hi>Regeneration by Water</hi> and <hi>by the Sipirit;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of the same Rite, says, that Christians were <hi>sav'd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 3.5, 6.</note>
                     <hi>according to the Mercy of God, by the laver of Regeneration, and the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghost, which was shed upon them abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that Baptism with Water was the way of entitiling Christians to that Divine Gift, and a means of conveying it to them.</p>
                  <p>And so likewise as to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, it is intended not only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit to Christians the Elements of Bread and Wine in Memory of our Saviour's Passion;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> but according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Expression, <hi>the Cup of Blessing,</hi> then <hi>blessed</hi> is <hi>the Communion of the Blood of Christ, the Bread</hi> then <hi>broken</hi> is <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Body of Christ,</hi> viz. a <hi>Communion</hi> or <hi>Participation</hi> of all the Benefits purchas'd by breaking the Body and shedding the Blood of <hi>Jesus,</hi> of which a principal one is, the Grace of the Divine Spirit to strengthen our Souls.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this particular; The Gospel is styl'd,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> as I before observ'd, <hi>the Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6.</note> the Ministers of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are said to be <hi>Ministers not of the Letter, but of the Spirit.</hi> When they perform the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of their Function, one is said <hi>to Plant,</hi> and another <hi>to Water,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.5, 6.</note> whilst <hi>God giveth the increase,</hi> viz. by the Operation of his Holy Spirit accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying these external Ministrations; and finally the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52618:127"/>Church is said to be <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>the Spirit of God dwelleth amongst</hi> and <hi>in</hi> the Members of it; all which passages do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently import, that the external Ministrations of Religion in the Christian Church, are design'd as so many means of deriving the internal Grace of the good Spirit to those who faithfully make use of them.</p>
                  <p>And as to this, I may presume that it will not be pretended that any other institution of Religion hath afforded the like means. The Jews indeed abounded in external Ordinances; which they were commanded to observe, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets themselves intimate, and the Apostles more fully assure us, not as good in themselves, but as suited to their temper and present circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; which to free and generous Minds were indeed unpleasant and burdensome. Nor were they attended with that Promise of internal Grace and Assistance, which is annexed to the Christian Institutions.
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note> For as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> at large Discourses, The Jewish <hi>service stood only in Meats and Drinks, and divers Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shings and carnal Ordinances, impos'd on them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the time of Reformation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ch. 8.5.6.10.</note> all which were <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Examples and Shadows of heavenly things:</hi> But <hi>Jesus hath obtain'd a more excellent Ministry, by how much also he is the Mediator of a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which was establish'd upon better Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> viz. such as these, that <hi>God would put his Laws into their Mind, and write them in their Hearts; and that he would be to them a God, and they should be to him a People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52618:128"/>
                  <p>Every other Profession of Religion had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise its external Rites and Ordinances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; but I think I may fairly leave it to the Judgment of any serious Deist, whether the Christian Institutions already mentioned, are not much more rational, decent, easy, and every way better adapted to the ends for which they are design'd, than those of any other Religion, and consequently, whether in this instance also our Blessed Saviour hath not made the best Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us.</p>
                  <p>There remains yet one farther Difficulty which fallen Men lay under, which I am to consider in the last place, and to shew that our Lord hath in that instance likewise made due Provision for us, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> An incapacity of removing those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil and mischievous consequences, to which their Sins had expos'd them; and of obtaining for themselves that compleat Salvation which they stood in need of.</p>
                  <p>The remaining Consequences of our Apostacy from God, which I took notice of in a former Lecture,
<note place="margin">Lect. ij. p. 21, 22.</note> are all the Calamities of this present life, concluded at last with a Seperation of Soul and Body by Death, and followed in a future state with all those Evils, to which an immortal Soul seperated from its Body is there liable, which are more than we are able to enumerate, or so much as to conceive in the state in which we now are.</p>
                  <p>That Men were of themselves altogether una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either to avoid these Evils, or to deliver
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52618:128"/>themselves from them, is evident. No humane Wit or Power, as Experience proves, can ward off abundance of those Calamities to which all Men are obnoxious from the present state of things in this lower World; nor can the wealth of the richest Man upon Earth purchase an Exemption from them. The wise Man must die, as certainly as the Fool; the Prince, as the Peasant; and the Rich Man, as the Beggar. Nor have any of these the least power to dispose of their Souls, when they are dismiss'd into the World of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p>Much less are they able to obtain for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that Salvation, which will compleat their Happiness. All that is done for us in this life, even by our Blessed Saviour himself, is but the beginning of our Salvation; we are by him put into a sttate of Salvation, and guided in the way which leads directly and surely to the completi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: But we cannot be said to <hi>be saved,</hi> till every evil disposition be perfectly rooted out of our Souls; till our Spirits are restor'd to their perfect Health, and all the Habits of Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue are confirm'd in them; nor indeed till our Bodies also shall be raised again and united to our Souls.</p>
                  <p>For although the wisest of Philosophers, and the best of Christians have justly complain'd of these Bodies of Flesh, as clogs to their Spirits, and therefore may have desir'd and chosen to be deliver'd from them, in order to have their Spirits set at liberty from their present incumbrance; yet the natural abhorrence which all Men have of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52618:129"/>the separation of their two essential parts made by Death, and that ardent desire of life which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in humane Nature, seem plainly to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that we cannot be compleatly happy without consisting of Soul and Body united. And the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel confirms this Notion to us, by causing us to wait for our compleat Salvation till the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body.

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.4.</note>
                     <hi>We that are in this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be uncloath'd; but cloath'd upon; that morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity might be swallow'd up of life;</hi> intimating, that Christians will not be compleatly happy, till <hi>their Bodies</hi> shall be <hi>redeem'd</hi> from <hi>Corruption;</hi> and till their Souls shall be <hi>cloath'd</hi> with such Bodies as shall be prepar'd for them at the Resurrection; till which time, they will not be deliver'd from all the effects of the Divine Displeasure, nor clearly <hi>manifested</hi> to be <hi>the Children of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now 'tis apparent, past all dispute, that we can do nothing of all this for our selves; and that no other Institution of Religion, besides the <hi>Christian,</hi> hath discover'd to us, how it shall be done for us.</p>
                  <p>But in this instance also, our Blessed Saviour hath made abundant Provision. The Gospel hath assur'd us, and we Christians do firmly believe,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52618:129"/>as fundamental Articles of our Faith, that as our Lord died to made Expiation for our Sins, so he rose again from the dead; and that then, according to his own Declaration,
<note place="margin">Matth. 28.18.</note>
                     <hi>All power</hi> was <hi>given unto him in Heaven and in Earth;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1.20, 21, 22.</note> that <hi>God, having rais'd him from the dead, hath set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Principality and Power, and Might and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and every Name that is named, not only in this World, but also in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet; and given him to be the Head over all things to the Church:</hi> as also, that he will according to his Promise come again to perfect the great Work which he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and which he hath been carrying on by all the Methods I have hitherto mention'd.</p>
                  <p>Now allowing all this to be true, we have a plain account, how we shall be deliver'd from all the remaining evil Consequences of our Fall, and be made perfectly happy, to the utmost of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and capacities.</p>
                  <p>For hereby we are assur'd, That we have now a powerful Friend in Heaven in our own Nature;
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15, 16</note> One who <hi>can be touch'd with a feeling of our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> having been <hi>in all points tempted like as we are;</hi> and One who hath such an Interest in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all, that by him we may <hi>go freely to the throne of Grace, obtaining Mercy and finding Grace to help in time of need:</hi> who although he doth not think fit to deliver us at present from all the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of this Life,

                  <p>This is that Provision, which our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, according to the Declaration of his Gospel, hath graciously made, in this last instance of our Necessity; after which I need add no more, this being the completion of our Felicity, and of our <hi>Mediator's</hi> Undertaking.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have finish'd what I at first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, with respect to the <hi>intrinsick</hi> Evidence of Christianity, shewing its <hi>Credibility</hi> from considering the <hi>Persons</hi> whom <hi>Christ Jesus came to save;</hi> the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52618:130"/>Nature of the <hi>Salvation</hi> which he proposeth; and the <hi>Method</hi> in which he hath procur'd it.</p>
                  <p>If in doing this, I have laid down <hi>a true Scheme</hi> of our holy Profession (as I am verily persuaded I have) according to the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, and the general sense of the Christian Church; and if through this whole <hi>Scheme</hi> there is nothing but what is highly worthy of God, and extremely beneficial to his Creatures; nay if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Representation of Christianity, it not only infinitely excels all other Institutions of Religion, but is such, as that we are not able to frame an Idea of any Institution comparable to it, (as I firmly believe upon impartial consideration it will appear to be) it must then be granted that <hi>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Christ Jesus came into the World, to save Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore I heartily offer to the serious thoughts of all such Men, as have a just sense of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>natural Religion</hi> upon their Minds, and have accustom'd themselves <hi>to think seriously</hi> of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>external</hi> attestation, which God hath given to the Gospel, by <hi>Prophecies, Miracles,</hi> and an won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Success</hi> in its Propagation, will tend, where duly observ'd, not only farther to confirm this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick</hi> Evidence, but also to awaken and excite the minds of those, who are not us'd to serious think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or are strongly prejudic'd against Religion in general, through the violence of their corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. But when all is done, here we must fix; being assur'd, that as no Revelation can be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52618:131"/>from God, which is not worthy of him; so what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is so highly worthy of God as the Christian Revelation is, must be <hi>credible</hi> upon its <hi>own account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>May we, who profess to believe the Gospel, both on account of its <hi>intrinsick</hi> Evidence, and the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> attestation it hath had, and to be sensible of the excellent <hi>Method</hi> therein propos'd for <hi>the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Sinners,</hi> prove to the World the reality and the stedfastness of this our Faith, by its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our Spirits and our Lives. Then shall we our selves yield a farther attestation to the truth of our Blessed Saviour's Religion, by demonstrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Virtue and its Excellency to the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And may Almighty God, who hath thus graciously revea'ld himself to Mankind, by his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, send forth his holy Spirit, to accompany the preaching of this his Gospel, so that it may be more universally receiv'd, and more thoroughly obey'd in all the Nations of the Earth, to the Glory of his Holy Name, and the Salvation of Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now to the One God and Father of all, and to our Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the Eternal Spirit; our great Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and Sanctifier, be ascribed, as is most due, all Honor, Praise, and Glory, forever.</hi> Amen.</p>

                        </bibl>
                        <p>God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him, should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; but have everlasting. Life. For God sent not his Son into the World to condemn the World; but that the World through him might be saved.</p>
                     </q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THese are the Words of our Blessed Saviour, who, as he best understood the Extent of that Love, which moved the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Father to send him into the World, so he hath here express'd it in the fullest and most comprehensive Terms. The Love of God, not to any particular Nation, but to <hi>the World</hi> in general, was the Motive upon which he gave his Son. The Design of our Lord's coming was to save not any particular Race of Men, but the whole Race of Mankind, <hi>the World</hi> in general, without Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is indeed a Condition required of those who would partake of this Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> that all, to whom the Gospel of Christ is publish'd, should believe in him; no other Limitation is set, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52618:134"/>this very reasonable one, <hi>That whosoever believeth in him, should not perish; but have everlasting Life.</hi> This is indeed a Truth so plainly asserted in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse other Texts; 'tis moreover so agreeable to the Design and the Tenor of the Gospel throughout; 'tis finally so suitable to the Apprehensions which we naturally have of the infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, that I shall not insist upon the Proof of it; the Purpose of this Discourse being rather to obviate an Objection, which will easily arise in the Minds even of serious Men, such as are not dispos'd to cavil, but are us'd to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate both the Works and the Word of God, with Sobriety and Reverence, for whose Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I thought it worth the while to take this Matter into particular Consideration.</p>
                  <p>The Objection is this; If the love of God expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in giving his only begotten Son, be so Great, and so Universal, as it is here represented; whence comes it to pass, that so small a part of Mankind seem to have receiv'd Benefit from the Christian Revelation? The Case of all Men seems to have been equally deplorable, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionable: If then the Love of God, testified by our Redeemer, were extended to all Men, if the coming of the Son of God into the World, were designed and fitted for the Benefit of all; is it not very strange, that four thousand Years should be run out before he came; and that since his appearing so small a Part of the World in comparison should be blest with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what he hath done for them, or of what he offereth to them?</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52618:134"/>
                  <p>Now for the easing our Minds under this Difficulty, I shall proceed gradually, laying down several Propositions, which will mutually sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each other, and which being impartially consider'd and lay'd together, may suffice to silence this Objection, if not fully satisfie those that make it. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> If we were able to give no tolerable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Matter, yet we ought not to be surprized or stumbled at it, because of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite distance between God and us.</p>
                  <p>They are very reasonable Questions which <hi>Job</hi>'s Friend put to him, when he in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Soul complain'd of his grievous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and was at a loss with Respect to the Justice of God's Dealings with him.
<note place="margin">Job. 11 7. 8, 9.</note>
                     <hi>Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection? It is as high as Heaven; What canst thou do? deeper than Hell; what canst thou know? The Measure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea. Great is our Lord,</hi> saith the Psalmist,
<note place="margin">Psalm 147.5.</note>
                     <hi>and</hi> not only <hi>of great Power;</hi> but <hi>his Understanding</hi> also <hi>is infinite.</hi> And shall we finite Creatures think then to comprehend his Ways? Shall we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon our selves competent Judges of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought otherwise, when contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating a Difficulty of Providence, of the same kind with that before us, he cries out,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.33, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>
                     <hi>O the Depth of the Riches, both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways past finding out! For who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52618:135"/>hath known the Mind of the Lord; or who hath been his Counsellor?</hi> It must be own'd, that we are not able to account for the Methods of Divine Providence in many other Instances; and whosoever is not abandon'd of all Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, must readily acknowledge, that it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that it should be so. For we have not the entire Scheme of Providence in our Heads at once; we cannot see from the beginning to the end of God's Ways; we know not what are the Designs, and what will be the Issues of his Counsels; and therefore ought to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our Judgments, till the Conclusion and winding up of Things. Which will appear to be more especially fit in this Case, if we consider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we our selves may discern several Particulars, in which we are manifestly ignorant, which yet ought to be known by us, if we would pretend fully to account for the Difficulty before us. I might give many Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but will content my self with two plain Ones.</p>
                  <p>He that would give a full Account of this Matter, must be acquainted with two Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which no mortal Man can certainly know, without an especial Revelation from God; namely, Whether those to whom the Gospel is not published during this Life, shall ever hear of it in any future State: And again, What Measures God will at the last Day take with those, to whom the Gospel was not publish'd.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52618:135"/>
                  <p>No Man certainly knows, whether those who never heard of the Gospel in this Life, may not in some future State have it publish'd to them.</p>
                  <p>It has been supposed by some, that those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, who shall have approv'd themselves Honest and Sincere in this their State of Tryal, may, when their Souls shall be separated from their Bodies, have the Gospel reveal'd to them in their separate State, in order to their becoming capable of the Rewards of Christians, at the last Day.</p>
                  <p>A late Learned and Ingenious Writer has es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed to make it probable,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Stay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e,</hi> of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Christ</hi> alone.</note> from a Prophetical Paragraph in the Apocalypse, that those, who shall have liv'd and dy'd without hearing of the Gospel in this present State, shall, after our Saviour's return, before the final Period of this World, be rais'd again, and have the Gospel preach'd to them, and thereby be put into a new State of Tryal, in order to their Salvation or Damnation, as they shall then acquit themselves.</p>
                  <p>Now though I will neither affirm nor deny either of these Opinions to be true, nor so much as say, that they are probable; yet this I will venture to say, That I believe it very difficult for any Man to prove that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be True; and yet if either of them should prove True, the Difficulty before us would be perfectly solv'd. And thus much we may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infer from these Conjectures, that if contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Men can think of some such possible Ways for the solving this Difficulty, there may be many more Ways of doing it known to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52618:136"/>Divine Understanding, and which will be clear and easie to our Understandings also, when it shall please God to reveal any of them to us. And I confess, I would suppose any thing that is plausible, nay, any thing that is possible, much rather than entertain one hard thought of the Maker and the Redeemer of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>But yet farther, no Man certainly knows what Measures God will take at the last day with those, who shall have liv'd and dyed unacquainted with the Gospel. We are certainly inform'd, how God will deal with those to whom the Gospel is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd; <hi>He that believeth, shall be saved: And he that believes not shall be damned.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 16.16.</note> But this <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> or <hi>not, believing</hi> plainly supposes the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preach'd to them, it being impossible, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> suggests, that <hi>they should believe in him, of whom they have not heard;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.14</note> and as impossible that <hi>they should hear, without a Preacher.</hi> And how God will deal with those who were under this disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the Gospel hath not so expresly told us, it's Declarations being to them, to whom it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd. But because this will fall under considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in another Place, I will add no more here, but proceed to my next Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We may our selves discern very much of the Reasonableness and fitness of that Method, which Providence hath taken, both as to the time of our Saviour's coming into the World, and the way and manner in which he order'd his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to be publish'd.</p>
                  <p>Almighty God, having made Men reasonable Creatures, hath all along dealt with them as such,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52618:136"/>in a way very suitable to their Nature, and their present Condition in this Life. His Providence wisely and gently orders and over-rules the Affairs of Mankind, with as little Violence as is possible, drawing and leading Men to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Amendment, rather than driving and compelling them. Accordingly ever since the Fall, it hath pleas'd God to use such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as might reasonably promote, tho' not necessitate their Recovery.</p>
                  <p>Thus in the first Ages of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Impressions which God had left of himself upon the Minds of Men in their very make, and what they might farther have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of him by contemplating his Works, there was a plain and certain Tradition both of his first forming Man, of the Law he gave to our first Parents, of their Fall, and of the kind Intimations of the Divine Compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them after their Fall; there was, I say, a plain and certain Tradition of all these and many more Particulars, easily deriv'd down from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah; Adam</hi> being able fully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>Methuselah,</hi> and <hi>Methuselah</hi> to inform <hi>Noah</hi> of all that each of them knew. And this one would in reason judge had been a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means of instructing and reclaiming the sinful Race of <hi>Adam.</hi> And accordingly there were some in each Generation, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd from their fallen Estate to that degree, as to become acceptable to God themselves, and Instructors and Examples to others.
<note place="margin">Gen. 5.24.</note> Thus we read of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that <hi>he walked with God,</hi> that is, <hi>pleased him</hi> by a pious and virtuous Course
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52618:137"/>of Life, and not only by his Conversation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
<note place="margin">Jude, 14.15.</note> but, as St. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us, <hi>prophesyed</hi> also against <hi>the ungodly Sinners</hi> of that Age, and was indeed so much too good for a bad World, that <hi>God took him</hi> to himself, as an Encouragement to the few Good, and a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the many Bad Men of those times. <hi>Noah</hi> was such another,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.9.</note> of whom it is said, that <hi>he was a just Man, and perfect</hi> (or <hi>upright) in his Generations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Set. 2.5.</note> and that <hi>he walked with God;</hi> as likewise that he was <hi>a Preacher of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> to <hi>the World of the Ungodly.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these external Means of Instruction and Reformation, 'tis intimated, that <hi>God's Spirit</hi> also was all that while <hi>striving with Men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed when none of all these Means would prevail, but the Case of Mankind was become deplorable and utterly desperate,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note> when <hi>God saw that the Wickedness of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only evil,</hi> and that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually;</hi> then, and not till then, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to interpose miraculously, by <hi>destroying Man from the Face of the Earth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 7.</note> reserving only <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, as the Seed of a new and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter World.</p>
                  <p>When by this Means there was a new Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Mankind, when <hi>Noah,</hi> being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a good Man, and extraordinarily preserv'd and instructed by God, was able to convey to his Off-spring a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52618:137"/>Stupendous Judgment whereby the old World was destroy'd, one would have thought again, that this should have effectually secur'd his Race in the Practice of Piety and Virtue for the future.</p>
                  <p>But when his Posterity also soon degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so that in the Space of somewhat more than four hundred Years, even Idolatry began to infect the purest Branch deriv'd from him, God then by a special Providence again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpos'd, chusing <hi>Abraham,</hi> calling him forth from his Country and his Kindred, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and guiding him, and as a Reward of his Eminent Faith and Piety, appointing his Posterity to be his peculiar People, whom he preserv'd and govern'd in a miraculous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from one Generation to another, thereby to awaken other Nations, if they would observe the wonderful Works of Providence towards that People; or at least to preserve one Nation from the General Contagion.</p>
                  <p>Amongst them God raised up a Great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, with a Succession of Prophets, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering still by degrees more of his Kind Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards them and all the World, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising in due time to raise up of the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> One who should be the great Deliverer and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Mankind.</p>

Finally, it was then, when first by the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and afterward more fully by the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, a considerable part of the World was not only conquer'd, but civiliz'd also, and an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course between many Nations establish'd, and thereby a Way made for the more easie Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Gospel, from <hi>Judea,</hi> throughout the then known Regions of the Earth. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly This was the fittest Season, that ever yet had been for the Appearance of the Saviour of Mankind.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52618:138"/>
                  <p>If we farther proceed to consider, in what manner our Lord appointed his Gospel to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and what Course the first Preachers of it took to that purpose, we shall still perceive more of the Reasonableness and Fitness of the Method wich Providence hath used in this Case.</p>
                  <p>When our Lord commission'd his Apostles, it was <hi>to make Disciples out of all Nations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 28.19. Mark 16.15.</note> and <hi>to go into all the World and preach the Gospel to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Creature.</hi> And the Doctrine which they were to preach, was admirably suited to this End. It was a Doctrine Rational and Pure, fit to be understood and receiv'd by every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Heaven, containing nothing Singular, nothing Narrow, nothing that might separate or distinguish one Nation or Family from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but equally adapted to the Condition of all Mankind.</p>
                  <p>There was indeed an occasion here for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Interposition of Providence, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it pleas'd God to interpose. For because those, whom our Lord sent to preach his Gospel, were unable to speak the Languages of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations, to which they were sent, and considering farther the strong Prejudices that the World lay under against this (to them) new Religion, God therefore bestow'd upon them the Gift of speaking whatsoever Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges should be necessary for propagating the Crhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine, and also a power of working o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miracles, to excite and move their Auditors, first to gain their Attention, and then to convince
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52618:139"/>their Judgments; which Powers continued in the Christian Church, as long as they were necessary, that is till the GOSPEL was considerably spread abroad, and able to support and propagate it self by more Natural Means.</p>
                  <p>Such indeed was the Fidelity and Industry of the Apostles and their immediate Successors, and so conformable were their Lives to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Doctrine which they preach'd, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity had incredible Success in those early times, insomuch that in about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, it prevail'd against all the false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, which had been so long receiv'd, and became the establish'd Religion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p>This was the Course which Providence took for the dispersion of the Knowledge of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Religion throughout the World, which as it was the most Natural and most reasonable Means to that End, so I can hardly doubt, but that if the Christians of the Ages following had continu'd to recommend their Profession by the Exemplariness of their Lives, and had retain'd that Zeal which their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors shewed for propagating it in the World, it had long before this been the establish'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Mankind. So that if the Gospel be not publish'd to the World universally, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from any defect in the Provision which God hath made to that purpose; but from the Fault of those to whom God had committed so great a Trust. Had Christian Princes been as zealous to promote the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52618:139"/>of our Lord, as to extend their Empire; (I mean not by Violence, but in Methods suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Nature of this Religion;) had Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Subjects been as eager to advance the Knowledge of our Maker and Redeemer in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts, as they have been to settle Trade and Commerce there; had all of us, who call our selves Christians, <hi>shewed forth</hi> in Christian Tempers and Practices, <hi>the Virtues of Him that called us,</hi> and the Excellency of the Religion he hath taught us; there would probably have been no Occasion for enquiring, as we now do, why the Gospel of our Lord is confin'd within so narrow Bounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As I have just now mention'd the open and evident Cause's, of the Gospel being not farther propagated, so there may be another more secret and hidden Reason, of God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting some Parts of the Earth to remain ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Christian Revelation. 'Tis what we cannot be sure of, in all the Instances of this kind: But 'tis what seems highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable as to some of them, and what some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in Scripture seem to hint, <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath in Justice permitted this, either because, when the Gospel was first preach'd to some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they utterly rejected it; or because he knew, what God only can know, that some Nations were so wholly indispos'd to receive it, that the Preaching of it to them would have had no other effect, but to have aggravated their Condemnation.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52618:140"/>
                  <p>We read that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> with <hi>Timothy, were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the Word in</hi> Asia;
<note place="margin">Act. 16, 6, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

It is said that at <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Lord exciting St. <hi>Paul</hi> by another Vision to preach the Gospel there, assign'd this as one Reason, <hi>For I have much People in this City,</hi>

                  <p>This is very agreeable to the Directions, which our Lord gave his Apostles,
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.11, 14.</note> when he sent them abroad to preach; <hi>Into whatsoever City or Town ye shall enter, enquire, Who in it is worthy.</hi> And again, <hi>Whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your Words, when ye depart out of that House or City, shake off the Dust of your Feet,</hi> namely,

                     <hi>as a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against them,</hi> that they had the offer of the Gospel, but were so wicked as to reject it. Tis consonant also to our Saviour's Declaration, that <hi>Whosoever hath, to him shall be given,</hi>

                  <p>'Tis certain, that this may be assign'd as a Reason, why the Light of the Gospel is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from, or at least very much obscured in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Places, where it once shone very bright, namely, that it was not duly improv'd by those whom it enlightned. We know how our Lord threaten'd the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 2.4, 5.</note> for <hi>leaving her first Love. Remember therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52618:141"/>Works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candlestick out of his Place, except thou repent,</hi> which Threatning has been long since remarkably fulfill'd, in the prevailing of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanism</hi> in those Parts; and if GOD hath not dealt as severely with others, who may have deserv'd it as much, his <hi>Goodness</hi> should not make them presume; but <hi>lead them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I have yet farther this weighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to offer in this Case, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Efficacy of our Saviour's Undertaking for Men, doth certainly extend much farther than the actual Knowledge of him doth.</p>
                  <p>This must be suppos'd as to Infants, at least such as are enter'd into the Christian Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by Baptism, that they are capable of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jesus Christ, without actually know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing in him. This must again be allow'd, as to all the good Patriarchs, and other pious Men amongst the Jews, who although they did believe and hope in God, for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the great Promise of a <hi>Messiah</hi> to come, yet did not see that Promise fulfill'd, nor could actually know and believe in him, as we do.</p>
                  <p>Such in truth was the Goodness of God to Mankind, as to testifie his Compassion towards them immediately after the Fall, by the Promise then made of <hi>the Woman's Seed,</hi> that is, of <hi>the Messiah,</hi> which Promise as it was renew'd upon all occasions, so as an Effect of his Interposition, were confer'd all the Benefits which Mankind
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52618:141"/>receiv'd from God, after the sin of our first Parents. It was upon his account that they were respited from present Death; and that their Posterity have been blest with all those Favours, Temporal and Spiritual, which they have enjoy'd from that time to this; insomuch that the Efficacy of our Lord's Undertaking is to bear date from the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of it; nay, from the Purpose and Intention of God before his actual Promise. But more particularly yet;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Holy Scriptures do every where represent our Saviour, as having made Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for the sins of all Mankind, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as well those who were born before his appearing, as since; and those who live in the remotest and darkest Corners of the Earth, as those to whom the Gospel is publish'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is the Propitiation for our sins,</hi> saith St. <hi>John;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 2 2.</note>
                     <hi>and not for ours only; but also for the sins of the whole World. There is,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                     <hi>one Mediator between God and Men, who gave himself a Ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</hi> And the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in a set Discourse, expresly makes the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Christ's Death, in the design of it, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as far as the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> had done.

                  <p>In the first Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> there was no Allowance made of Repentance after Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression: but upon the Interposition of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and in Virtue of that Expiation, which he was to make, when he should come into the World, sinners were allowed and encouraged to repent and turn to God, in hopes of obtaining his Favor. The very respiting our first Parents from the execution of the Sentence denounced, was an intimation that Repentance would be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God; the Promise made soon after the Fall was a Confirmation of the same thing. God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and encouraging Sacrifices still farther encouraged Repentance.

<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note> yet is in very general Terms, and such as seem to concern all Mankind; <hi>As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the Death of the Wicked; but that the Wicked turn from his way and live;</hi> with much more to the same purpose, in the following Verses. In the Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> we find that <hi>Nineveh,</hi> a Pagan City, was spar'd upon the Humiliation of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.

And altho' this Doctrine is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched only to those, to whom the Oracles of God are publish'd; yet we cannot from thence fairly conclude, that if in any other part of the World there be found any true Penitents, their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance shall not be accepted of God, because they were not expresly told so beforehand. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as the Consideration of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will dispose us to hope the best, so there are diverse Hints in the Oracles of God themselves, which may incline us to take the favourable side in this Controversie. St. <hi>Peter</hi> seems to have done so, when upon observing how God had accepted the Prayers and the Alms of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he own'd himself convinc'd of a Mistake which he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before, crying out, <hi>Of a truth I perceive,</hi>

                  <p>'Tis true, sometimes Faith is made the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Acceptance with God, as well as Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, particularly in our Text, it is expresly made the Condition of Salvation: but then if by Faith be to be understood an express believing in Jesus Christ, it must be restrain'd to them to whom he is preach'd. For, as I observ'd before, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and other good Men of the Jewish Nation, were accepted upon their Faith, believing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God, and obeying his Commands, before the coming of our Lord, and when they had very obscure Notions concerning him. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in his excellent Discourse of Faith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> even that Faith which is acceptable to God, defines it in general, <hi>a believing that God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi> Which indeed will include believing in God, as <hi>a Rewarder of them that seek him through Jesus Christ,</hi> where the Gospel is publish'd: But it seems evidently to imply also, that God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such a degree of Faith in him, as is suitable to the Revelation he hath made of himself, be it more or less. What else can we think of such a Man as <hi>Job</hi> for Instance, concerning whom it is said,

<note place="margin">Gen. 20.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> though unwittingly, and <hi>in the integrity of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52618:143"/>his Heart?</hi> And altho' I dare not profess my self assur'd of the State of <hi>Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Epictetus;</hi> yet I cannot but be strongly inclin'd to hope, that the Expiation of our Redeemer may have render'd their Repentance and Obedience in a good degree acceptable to God. And God only knows, how many more penitent and sincere Souls may be found, in the dark Corners of the Earth. It may be, for ought we know, in this Case, as in that of <hi>Elijah,</hi> who imagin'd himself left alone,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 19.14, 18.</note> when God knew of no less than <hi>seven thousand in</hi> Israel, <hi>who had not bowed the Knee to</hi> Baal. But yet farther,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Another Effect of the Expiation made by our Redeemer, may have been, for ought any Man can know to the contrary, the secret Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Influence of the Divine Spirit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning and moving the Minds of Men, in all parts of the World.</p>
                  <p>Tis acknowledgd, that no Man can either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or believe in God, or obey him accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, without the Assistance of the good Spirit; 'tis confess'd also that this Assistance is expresly promis'd only through Jesus Christ: but I should be very loth to affirm, that it was never impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any, who were not actually instructed in the Christian Doctrine There can be no doubt, with Respect to the Patriarchs, who were the Friends and Favorites of God, and by their Faith and Piety demonstrated, that they were enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd and mov'd by his Spirit. The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> did not expresly promise the Assistance of the Spirit; and yet there is no Question, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52618:144"/>that pious and good Men among the Jews did partake of it. And shall we confine it to them only? No! I would rather hope that <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Abimelech</hi> before mention'd, nay, that <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Epictetus</hi> also, in their Measure, partook of the same; the Fruits of that Divine Spirit methinks very evidently appear in many of their Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Actions. Diverse Pagans, as I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a former Lecture, have been sensible of this Truth, and openly avow'd that the Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God was necessary to Virtue, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly believ'd that such as were truly Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous amongst themselves, were so by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Divine Spirit. And it seems high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy of God, to believe thus; at least not to believe otherwise.</p>
                  <p>And indeed if we reflect upon the Notion, which was current amongst the best and most ancient Christian Writers, and which the Holy Scriptures seem to have led them into, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Dispensation of God towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by our Redeener, we shall the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be dispos'd to be of this Judgment. For they look'd upon our Saviour, as not only designing, but beginning his Transactions for the good of Men, from the time of their first Creation; and for the Recovery of Sinners, from the time of their Fall. They believ'd that diverse of the Appearances, mention'd in the Old Testament, were really of the Son of God, in Angelical Form, anticipating thereby and prefiguring his Appearance at last in Humane Nature. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it was He, who conducted the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan;</hi> that it was He,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52618:144"/>who was in the Tabernacle, and in the Temple, in the midst of the Cloud, towards whom therefore the Jews paid their solemn Adorations. And for the like Reason they believ'd, that it was He, who inspir'd all the great and good Men, that were eminent for Piety and Virtue, either among the Jews, or in any other Nations. In a word,
<note place="margin">John 1.9.</note> they understood St <hi>John</hi> to mean as much, where he says, <hi>That was the true Light, which enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> not only by imparting the Powers of Understanding and Reason to them in their first Formation; but also by farther opening their Understandings, and improving their Minds, as they should become capable, by the secret Suggestions and Motions of his Spirit. So that, although he did not appear in Humane Form, till four thousand Years were elaps'd; yet he had not neglected Mankind all that space of time; nor doth at present neglect those who have not heard of his Incarnation; but <hi>was</hi> and <hi>is in the VVorld,</hi> even in those Parts of it,
<note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> where <hi>they know him not,</hi> using those Methods, which to his Divine Wisdom seem meet, for the training up well-dispos'd Minds, which do not resist the Grace which he offers to them. There is but one Proposition more that I have to add, and it is this, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Our Lord hath expresly declar'd, that <hi>unto whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever much is given,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis very true, that the Salvation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is by the Gospel promis'd only to those who believe and obey it, and consequently to whom it is preach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d; as Damnation is therein expresly threatened to those who reject it; and we are not so plainly told what kind and what degrees of Rewards and Punishments God will dispense to others: but we are in the general assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52618:145"/>that the Recompences of that Day shall be all just, and carry a Respect to <hi>the Deeds done in the Body,</hi> bearing some Proportion to the different Circumstances and Conditions of Men. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> a little before his Discourse just now cited, lets us know, that the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of wicked <hi>Gentiles</hi> would be very just, by Reason of their having despis'd the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Nature and Reason, because <hi>they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Truth in Unrighteousness;</hi> for,

                     <hi>and move and have our Being,</hi> that we may even <hi>feel after him,</hi>

                     <hi>and find him;</hi> and he hath <hi>written</hi> his <hi>Law</hi> in such visible Characters in all <hi>our Hearts,</hi> shewing us the plain Difference between moral Good and Evil, in the chief Instances thereof, causing our <hi>Consciences</hi> to <hi>bear witness,</hi> and our <hi>Thoughts</hi> to <hi>accuse</hi> or <hi>excuse,</hi> as we demean our selves, that he may justly call us to an Account for such our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor.</p>
                  <p>So that the whole Matter at last comes to this Issue. Some Men have, by hearing the Gospel preach'd to them, far greater Advantages, than others; but then they are accountable likewise for those special Advantages: whereas such, as not through their own default, but by the meer Providence of God, want those Advantages, shall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52618:146"/>be answerable for no more, than what they have been entrusted with. God hath done more for those, than for these; and 'tis but fit, that he should freely dispose of his own Gifts, <hi>after the Counsel of his own Will:</hi> but if he doth what is abundantly sufficient for all, and will expect no more, than in proportion to what he gives, there remains no just Ground of complaint to any.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have done with what I thought fit to be offer'd on this difficult Argument; and I hope, if what I have propos'd be consider'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prejudice, it may suffice to make us humbly acquiesce in the Dispensation of God by Jesus Christ, acknowledging that the Design of our Lord's coming was <hi>to save Sinners</hi> in general; and confessing to the glory of the Almighty Father, that his <hi>love</hi> was manifested to <hi>the whole Race of Mankind,</hi> by <hi>sending his only begotten Son into the World</hi> for our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude all with two practical Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Frist,</hi> We may infer from hence the great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation which lies upon us, to whom the Gospel is publish'd, to comply with the Terms of it, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>that</hi> mention'd in the Text as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of all others, <hi>believing in Jesus Christ.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gracious Allowances God in his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may make to others, we cannot hope for <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> upon any other Conditions, than a grateful Acknowledgment of this infinite Love of God, a firm and stedfast Faith in his only begotten Son, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an hearty Resignation of our selves to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52618:146"/>his Conduct. As by these our Priviledges we are <hi>exalted to Heaven;</hi> so upon our abuse of them, we shall be <hi>cast down</hi> to the lowest depth of <hi>Hell. This</hi> (as our Saviour declared,
<note place="margin">Verse 19.</note> a little after the Text) <hi>is the Condemnation, that light it come into the World; but Men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Love of God toward Mankind be so extensive, it becomes us then, instead of caviling at the Divine Providence on account of the Gospel's not being publish'd to all the World, to do our part towards the Propagation of it</p>
                  <p>The Princes and great Men of the Earth may do very much to this purpose, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy observ'd. Others also, especially those Bodies and Societies of Men, which have Commerce with the Gentile World, might contrive Methods for propagating their Religion together with their Trade.
<note place="margin">This the pious Founder of these Lectures had a great sense of, when by a Clause in his Will, he obliged those who should preach them, <q rend="margQuotes">to be assisting to all Companys, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them in any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, for propagating the Christian Religion in foreign Parts.</q>
                     </note> And all of us might contribute to this generous Design, by our earnest Prayers to God for the enlarging of his Son's Kingdom, and that it would please him to excite the Spirits of those who have Power and Interest to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advance this Noble Work. In fine, we may all contribute towards it, by living Christian Lives; and if we have neither Power nor Interest to promote the <hi>Profession</hi> of our Religion in Foreign Parts, we may at least promote the <hi>Practise</hi> of it at Home, by our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52618:147"/>Examples. Nothing in truth would so powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend our Holy Religion to Mankind, in order both to the Belief and Practice of it, as to have it fairly represented by the Tempers and Lives of its Professors. <hi>May Almighty God revive the Spirit of Primitive Christianity, in those who take upon them the Christian Name; and may their light shine so clearly and brightly, as to enlighten the darkest and remotest Regions of the Earth, to the Glory of God and our Redeemer.</hi> Amen.</p>
